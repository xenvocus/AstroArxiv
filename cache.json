Fast-time variations in the neutrino\nluminosity and mean energy can provide insights into phenomena like turbulence,\nconvection, and shock revival. In this paper, we explore the detection\ncapabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory and the planned IceCube-Gen2 detector in identifying generic\nfast-time features in the neutrino light curve. We also investigate the\npotential enhancement in detection sensitivity using wavelength shifters, which\ncan improve light collection efficiency. By employing a Short-Time Fourier\nTransform analysis, we quantify the excess power in the frequency spectrum\narising from fast-time modulations and compute the detection horizon for a\nrange of generic models. We find that with IceCube we can already see the\nstrongest modulation models (>50% amplitude) for progenitors located anywhere\nin the Milky Way. Sensitivity to weaker modulations (>20% amplitude) is\npossible in future detectors like IceCube-Gen2, in particular with the use of\nwavelength shifters. For all detector configurations, the frequency and central\ntime of the fast-time feature at the 5$\\sigma$ detection horizon can be\nmeasured with a resolution of 7.0 Hz and 17 ms respectively.\n","authors":["Jakob Beise","Segev BenZvi","Spencer Griswold","Nora Valtonen-Mattila","Erin O'Sullivan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05024v1.pdf","comment":"7 pages, 5 figures, prepared for submission to A&A"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04974v1","updated":"2025-02-07T14:47:33Z","published":"2025-02-07T14:47:33Z","title":"Speed of sound in Kaluza-Klein Fermi gas","summary":"  A five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime model is considered, with one extra\ncompactified spatial dimension.

The moment of inertia, compactness, love number,\nmass quadrupole moment, and oscillation modes are some of the properties that\nhave been studied previously in the context of universal relations. All of\nthese quantities are measurable; thus, analyzing them is of utmost importance.\nThis article analyzes the universal relations in the context of a neutron\nstar's gravitational redshift. Using the redshift measurements of RBS 1223, RX\nJ0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754, we provide theoretical estimates of\ncompactness, the inverse of compactness, the moment of inertia, dimensionless\ntidal love number, mass quadrupole moment, the mass of the star times the ratio\nof angular frequency over the spin angular moment, and the average of the speed\nof sound squared. In the case of the redshift measurement of RX J0720.4-3125,\nwe found that the theoretical estimate using universal relations aligns closely\nwith the Bayesian estimate. Our findings indicate that such theoretical\npredictions are highly reliable for observations with low uncertainty and can\nbe used as an alternative for statistical analysis. Additionally, we report a\nviolation of the universality of the tidal love number and average of the speed\nof sound squared with respect to the gravitational redshift.

The ejecta produce bright UV flares with bolometric\nluminosities typically peaking at $\\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining\nsteeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at\n0.5\\,d, and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$\n($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15\\,mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve\nconsiderably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated.\nThe UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O,\nwhereas the optical primarily shows H{\\,\\sc i}\\ Balmer lines. These properties\nare qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of\nType II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations\nwith collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity,\nand stellar masses.

A discovery\n  powered by machine learning","summary":"  Aims. We aim to understand the nature of the diffuse radio emission\nsurrounding the massive galaxy cluster PSZ2 G083.29-31.03, at z=0.412, already\nknown to host a radio halo. Our investigation was triggered by Radio U-Net, a\nnovel machine learning algorithm for detecting diffuse radio emission, which\nwas previously applied to the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). Methods. We\nre-processed LoTSS (120-168 MHz) data and analyzed archival XMM-Newton (0.7-1.2\nkeV) observations. We also analyzed optical and near-infrared data from the\nDESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and asses the mass distribution with weak-lensing\nanalysis based on archival Subaru Suprime-Cam and CFHT MegaPrime/MegaCam\nobservations. Results. We report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio\nemission around PSZ2 G083.29-31.03, with a projected largest linear size of 5\nMpc at 144 MHz. The radio emission is aligned with the thermal X-ray emission\nand the distribution of galaxies, unveiling the presence of two low-mass\nsystems, at similar redshifts on either side of the central cluster. The weak\nlensing analysis supports this scenario, demonstrating the presence of an\nextended and complex mass distribution. Conclusions. We propose to interpret\nthe two faint radio sources as connected to the central cluster, thus\nilluminating the presence of two substructures merging into a massive node of\nthe cosmic web. However, because of uncertainties in redshift and mass\nestimates, combined with the low resolution required to detect these sources,\nthe classification of the two sources as independent radio halos associated\nwith nearby low-mass clusters or even as a mixture of different types of\ndiffuse radio emission cannot be definitively ruled out.\n","authors":["C.

Forced X-ray aperture photometry was applied to an optically-selected\nsample of 235 groups (containing at least five member galaxies) to measure\ntheir X-ray luminosities in the regime of low signal to noise X-ray data. The\nsample encompasses X-ray luminosities over an order of magnitude fainter than\ntypical X-ray selected samples, and avoids X-ray selection biases. This gives\naccess to low mass groups where the effects of non-gravitational processes,\nsuch as AGN-feedback, should be most apparent and could inhibit their detection\nin an X-ray survey. We measured the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the\nsample, and found it to be consistent with the extrapolation of the XLF from\nX-ray selected samples at higher luminosities. The XLF was combined with a\ntheoretical halo mass function to infer the form of the scaling relation\nbetween X-ray luminosity and mass (LM relation) for the GAMA groups. We found a\nslope of $1.87 \\pm 0.12$, which is steeper than self similarity in this mass\nregime. When comparing with other measurements of the LM relation, we find\nevidence for a steepening of the slope in the low mass regime, likely due to\nthe impact of non-gravitational processes.

Physically, this means that if torsion is right\nchiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does\nnot change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion\nchirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field\nseeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion\nasymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed\nbeyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of\n$1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated\nmagnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic\nfields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful\ndynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of\n$10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$\nGauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a\ngalactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss.

In this work, we use high-resolution spectroscopy in\nthe near-infrared (NIR) to search for chemical signatures in the atmospheres of\nthe two hot Jupiters KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab, and perform a first\ncharacterisation of their atmospheric properties. We measured the transmission\nspectrum of each target with the NIR high-resolution spectrograph GIANO-B at\nthe TNG and searched for atmospheric signals by cross-correlating the data with\nsynthetic transmission spectra. In order to characterise the chemical-physical\nproperties of the two atmospheres, we ran two different atmospheric retrievals\nfor each dataset: a retrieval assuming chemical equilibrium and a\n``free-chemistry'' retrieval, in which the abundance of each molecule could\nvary freely. We detect $H_2O$ in the atmospheres of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab\nwith an S/N = 6.6 and S/N = 4.2, respectively. The two retrievals indicate a\nwater-rich atmosphere for both targets.

The break becomes more pronounced at\nlonger wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent\nmagnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an\nincreasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam,\n4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM\nsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the\norigin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for\nthe break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change\nin the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the\nk-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type\ngalaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass\nratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the\nluminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the\ngalaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of\napproximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is\nmainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z < 2) for the PEARLS\nobservational limit of m_AB < 28. We give a comprehensive description of why\nthe galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the\nway they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent\nmagnitude.\n","authors":["Giorgio Manzoni","Tom Broadhurst","Jeremy Lim","Tao Liu","George Smoot","Carlton M.

These perturbations,\nwhich can introduce a minor bump in the effective potential of the wave\nequation, give rise to a novel branch of asymptotic quasinormal modes, dubbed\nthe {\\it echo modes}, which lie mainly parallel to the real frequency axis.\nThis study explores the evolution of the echo modes and their interplay with\nthe outward spiral motion observed in low-lying quasinormal modes. As the bump\nin the effective potential moves away from the central black hole, the echo\nmodes collectively shift toward the real axis, with the spacing between\nsuccessive modes decreasing uniformly. This collective motion occurs\nsimultaneously with the spiral of the low-lying modes until the echo modes\neventually take over the fundamental quasinormal mode. In the time domain, such\na takeover coincides with a transition point for the temporal waveform, where\nthe distinction between the original black hole's ringdown and the echoes\nbecomes clear. This marks a transition in the characteristics of the waveform\nfrom primarily damped oscillations, dominated by the damping rate of the\nfundamental mode, to echo waves, characterized by periodic echo pulses. We\nargue that this phenomenon is universal by employing analytical and numerical\nanalyses. We first elucidate our arguments using explicit but simplified toy\nmodels, where the effective potential barriers are disjoint. The derivations\nare then generalized to scenarios where perturbations are introduced on top of\na black hole metric with a continuous effective potential. The observational\nimplications, particularly the causality dilemma, are elaborated. We show that\nthe echo modes can be extracted by applying the Fourier transform to ringdown\nwaveforms, which can be important for gravitational wave observations.\n","authors":["Ramin G.

In this\nmodel, the accretion stream from the secondary white dwarf in a double white\ndwarf binary strikes the primary white dwarf violently enough to trigger a\nhelium shell detonation, which in turn triggers a carbon/oxygen core\ndetonation. If the secondary white dwarf survives the primary's explosion, it\nwill be flung away as a hypervelocity star. While previous work has shown that\nthe hotter observed D6 stars can be broadly understood as secondaries whose\nouter layers have been heated by their primaries' explosions, the properties of\nthe cooler D6 stars have proven difficult to reproduce. In this paper, we show\nthat the cool D6 stars can be explained by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of\nhelium or carbon/oxygen white dwarfs that underwent significant mass loss and\ncore heating prior to and during the explosion of their white dwarf companions.\nWe find that the current population of known D6 candidates is consistent with\n~2% of Type Ia supernovae leaving behind a hypervelocity surviving companion.\nWe also calculate the evolution of hot, low-mass oxygen/neon stars and find\nreasonable agreement with the properties of the LP 40-365 class of\nhypervelocity survivors, suggesting that these stars are the kicked remnants of\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass oxygen/neon white dwarfs that were partially disrupted\nby oxygen deflagrations.

These simulations were also used to perform an analysis of the\nrecovered parameter uncertainties and potential biases in the measurements.\nWithin the 329 spectra sample that we investigate, we identify 85 spectra\nexhibiting Si II $\\lambda$6355 HVFs. We find that HVFs decrease in strength\nwith phase relative to their photospheric counterparts - however, this decrease\ncan occur at different phases for different objects. HVFs with larger velocity\nseparations from the photosphere are seen to fade earlier leaving only the\ndouble components with smaller separations as we move towards maximum light.\nOur findings suggest that around three quarters of SN Ia spectra before -11 d\nshow high-velocity components in the Si II $\\lambda$6355 with this dropping to\naround one third in the six days before maximum light. We observe no difference\nbetween the populations of SNe Ia that do and do not form Si II $\\lambda$6355\nHVFs in terms of SALT2 light-curve parameter x1, peak magnitude, decline rate,\nhost mass, or host colour, supporting the idea that these features are\nubiquitous across the SN Ia population.\n","authors":["L.

Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and\ncomplex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse\nstars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry\n99\\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in\nunderstanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic\nObservatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a\nsodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next\ngalactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate\ndetectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core\nof the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating\ncalorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos\n(CE$\\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic\ndetectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc\nwithout pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\\nu$NS events from a\nsupernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a\ncylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank\nacts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation\ninduced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic\nradioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily\ndetected inducing $\\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a\n3$\\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\\sim$10 events. This\npaper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter\nexperiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect\nthe next galactic core-collapse supernova.\n","authors":["G.

Spin-orbit\nresonances are one process of interest, in which the component spin vectors and\nthe orbital angular momentum align into a common plane and jointly precess\nabout the total angular momentum of the system. These resonances, which occur\npreferentially in systems formed via isolated binary evolution with strong\ntidal effects, lead to excesses in the distribution of the azimuthal angle\nbetween the projections of the component spin vectors onto the orbital plane at\n$\\phi_{12}=0,\\pm\\pi$. Previous analyses have demonstrated that this parameter\nis particularly difficult to constrain for individual binaries. In this work,\nwe conduct the first hierarchical analysis modeling the population-level\ndistribution of $\\phi_{12}$ simultaneously with the other mass and spin\nparameters for simulated binary black hole populations to determine whether\nspin-orbit resonances can be reliably constrained. While we are unlikely to\nfind definitive evidence for spin-orbit resonances with a population of the\nsize expected by the end of the ongoing LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run,\nwe correctly recover the various $\\phi_{12}$ distributions we simulate within\nuncertainties. We find that we can place meaningful constraints on the relative\nexcesses at $\\phi_{12}=0,\\pm\\pi$, which encodes information about mass transfer\nin the formation of the binary. We can also distinguish between fully isotropic\nspin angle distributions and those with features in the spin azimuth and tilt\ndistributions. Thus, we show that population-level measurements of the\n$\\phi_{12}$ distribution offer a reliable, novel way to probe binary formation\nchannels, dynamics, and mass transfer with gravitational-wave observations.\n","authors":["Sylvia Biscoveanu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04278v1.pdf","comment":"26 pages, 5 tables, 20 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04264v1","updated":"2025-02-06T18:01:20Z","published":"2025-02-06T18:01:20Z","title":"Fundamental Oscillation Modes in Neutron Stars with Hyperons and Delta\n  Baryons","summary":"  For a new parameterization of the modified effective chiral model, developed\nprimarily to regulate the density content of the symmetry energy and its higher\norder terms, equations of state (EoSs) for hyperon-rich matter ($H$) and delta\nbaryon matter ($\\Delta$) were obtained.

However, these same photon fields can also attenuate gamma-rays through\ninternal photon-photon (gamma-gamma) absorption, imprinting characteristic\nspectral features. Investigating the internal absorption is crucial for\nunraveling the complex structure of FSRQs and constraining the poorly known\nlocation of the gamma-ray emission region. In this study, we select a sample of\ngamma-ray detected FSRQs with high redshift (z >= 3), to search for absorption\nfeatures appearing at lower photon energies due to a substantial redshift. We\nextract the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray spectra of these sources and perform physical\nmodeling using a detailed gamma-gamma opacity model, assuming that the BLR\nphoton field dominates the absorption and focusing on the energy range ~25\nGeV/(1+z), where the absorption feature due to Ly{\\alpha} photons is expected.\nOur analysis reveals a hint of internal absorption for one source (the lowest\nredshift object in our sample, z~3) and provides constraints on the location of\nits gamma-ray emitting region along the jet.

Subpulse emission is assumed coming from m\ndiscrete emission areas that are distributed around the magnetic axis on a\nrotating carousel. The flow rate of the emission areas is determined by the E x\nB drift in an emission state, designated by the parameter y, in which E and the\nassociated flow rate are dependent on y. In this model, subpulses appear to\ndrift in an emission state if a relative speed exists between the plasma flow\nand corotation, and the diversity in the drift rates and directions corresponds\nto the relative speed being different in different parts of a profile. We apply\nthe model to three pulsars that exhibit drifting subpulses of opposite drift\ndirections to identify the emission states and the values of m. Our results\nshow that different drifting subpulses correspond to particular values of m and\ny, and the latter implies that different emission states can coexist and\noperate concurrently in an emission region. We find that m does not show clear\ndependency on either the obliquity angle or emission state. We demonstrate that\nsubpulse arrangement may vary across an emission region meaning that it is not\nalways uniform on a carousel. We discuss drifting subpulses of opposite drift\ndirections and subpulse drift-rate switching in terms of different emission\nstates in our model, and speculate that they may be two manifestations of the\nsame underlying mechanism.\n","authors":["H.

Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and\ncomplex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse\nstars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry\n99\\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in\nunderstanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic\nObservatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a\nsodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next\ngalactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate\ndetectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core\nof the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating\ncalorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos\n(CE$\\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic\ndetectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc\nwithout pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\\nu$NS events from a\nsupernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a\ncylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank\nacts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation\ninduced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic\nradioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily\ndetected inducing $\\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a\n3$\\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\\sim$10 events.

Specifically, a GAN emulator is first trained with a\nhuge number of small-scale simulations, and then transfer-learned with only a\nlimited number of large-scale simulations, to emulate large-scale 21~cm\nlightcone images. We test the precision of our transfer-learned GAN emulator in\nterms of representative statistics including global 21~cm brightness\ntemperature history, 2D power spectrum, and scattering transform coefficients.\nWe demonstrate that the lightcone images generated by the transfer-learned GAN\nemulator can reach the percentage level precision in most cases on small\nscales, and the error on large scales only increases mildly to the level of a\nfew tens of per cent. Nevertheless, our multi-fidelity emulation technique\nsaves a significant portion of computational resources that are mostly consumed\nfor generating training samples for GAN. On estimate, the computational\nresource by training GAN completely with large-scale simulations would be one\nto two orders of magnitude larger than using our multi-fidelity technique. This\nimplies that our technique allows for emulating high-fidelity, traditionally\ncomputationally prohibitive, images in an economic manner.\n","authors":["Kangning Diao","Yi Mao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04246v1.pdf","comment":"20 pages, 16 figures.

These two tasks are often treated as\nseparate: diffusion models trained for one purpose do not generalize to perform\nthe other task. In this paper, we develop a single diffusion model that can be\nused for both tasks. By using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) approach,\nwe use a diffusion model trained to simulate weak lensing maps for the inverse\nproblem of reconstructing mass maps from noisy weak lensing data. We find that\nthe standard DPS method leads to biased inference but we correct this bias by\ndown weighting the likelihood term at early sampling time steps of the\ndiffusion. Our method give us a way to reconstruct accurate high-resolution\n(sub-arcminute) mass maps that have the correct power spectrum and a range of\nnon-Gaussian summary statistics. We discuss several applications enabled by the\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy of our model. These include generation of\nsimulation quality mass maps, aiding covariance estimation for higher order\nstatistics, and for finding filaments, voids and clusters from noisy lensing\nshear data.\n","authors":["Supranta S.

In\nPaper II, we further improved its performance in noise characterization by\nreplacing its null stream with a specialized stable channel, $C^{12}_3$. In\nthis work, we propose a novel TDI configuration, labeled PD4L, which features\nminimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. Unlike the hybrid Relay or\nthe second-generation Michelson, which require a maximum delay of $7L$ (where\n$L$ is the ranging time of interferometric arm), the PD4L synthesizes data only\nwithin $3L$ delay. This shorter time span brings several advantages: 1)\nreducing margins at boundaries of data segments, 2) mitigating frequency\naliasing in the high frequency band, and 3) shortening the tail at the end of a\nsignal. To assess its effectiveness in data analysis, we perform parameter\ninference for a rapidly chirping gravitational wave signal from a MBBH. As a\nmore compact TDI structure, PD4L achieves more accurate parameters estimation\nin the frequency-domain compared to the hybrid Relay. Additionally, PD4L's null\nstream exhibits minimal null frequencies, identical to its science channels,\nwhile maintaining a more stable noise spectrum than the $C^{12}_3$. We further\nevaluate its capability in noise characterization. The results demonstrate that\nalthough the stability of noise spectra in science channels is slightly lower\ncompared to that of hybrid Relay, PD4L can still reliably infer noise\nparameters for data durations of up to four months. These investigations and\ncomparisons suggest that PD4L is a promising TDI scheme, particularly for the\nhigher frequency band.\n","authors":["Gang Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03983v1.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 9 figures, A follow-up to the works arXiv:2403.01490 and\n  arXiv:2406.11305"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03977v1","updated":"2025-02-06T11:18:02Z","published":"2025-02-06T11:18:02Z","title":"Performance Analysis of Digital Flux-locked Loop Circuit with Different\n  SQUID $V$-$φ$ Transfer Curves for TES Readout System","summary":"  A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), functioning as a\nnonlinear response device, typically requires the incorporation of a\nflux-locked loop (FLL) circuit to facilitate linear amplification of the\ncurrent signal transmitted through a superconducting transition-edge sensor\n(TES) across a large dynamic range.

Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nobserving runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals,\naccurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we\npresent pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the\ninspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries. pyEFPE improves upon\nprevious models by introducing analytical expressions for the Fourier mode\namplitudes, enhancing the numerical stability of the multiple scale analysis\nframework, and adding recently derived PN corrections, critical to accurately\ndescribe signals in GW detectors. Additionally, we simplify the numerical\nimplementation and introduce a scheme to interpolate the amplitudes, achieving\na speedup of up to ~O(20) in the waveform computations, making the model\npractical for data analysis applications. We thoroughly validate pyEFPE by\ncomparing it to other waveform models in the quasi-circular and\neccentric-spin-aligned limits, finding good agreement.

This paper\naims to analyse in detail the effects of GWs on an astrometric solution based\non Gaia-like observations, which are one-dimensional, strictly differential\nbetween two widely separated fields of view and following a prescribed scanning\nlaw. We present a simple geometric model for the astrometric effects of a plane\nGW in terms of the time-dependent positional shifts.

The resulting\nsolutions are analysed in terms of the systematic errors on astrometric and\nattitude parameters, as well as the observational residuals. It is found that a\nsignificant part of the GW signal is absorbed by the astrometric parameters,\nleading to astrometric errors of a magnitude (in radians) comparable to the\nstrain parameters. These astrometric errors are in general not possible to\ndetect, because the true (unperturbed) astrometric parameters are not known to\ncorresponding accuracy. The astrometric errors are especially large for\nspecific GW frequencies that are linear combinations of two characteristic\nfrequencies of the scanning law. Nevertheless, for all GW periods smaller than\nthe time span covered by the observations, significant parts of the GW signal\nalso go into the astrometric residuals.

The smooth dust morphology can be altered only when pressure\nbumps are present in the dead zone. However, when present at small radii (<=10\nau), pressure bumps cannot effectively trap dust. Dust in these bumps fragments\nand replenishes the inner discs, effectively hiding dust traps in the optically\nthick inner disc from observations.

The extreme irradiation can result in atmospheric species\nbecoming thermally ionized on the dayside, which then interact with the\nplanet's magnetic field by resisting flow across magnetic field lines, shaping\nthe atmospheric structure. However, an eccentric orbit results in temporally\ndependent irradiation and a non-permanent dayside, as the planet-star distance\ncan change drastically during its orbit. In this paper, we present 3D\natmospheric models of TOI-150b, an eccentric (e=0.26), Jupiter-mass 1.75 M_Jup\nplanet whose equilibrium temperature varies from 1300K to 1700K. We conduct\nsimulations for magnetic field strengths ranging from 0-30 Gauss using the\nkinematic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approach. When compared to simulations of\nthe planet assuming a circular orbit, we find that the eccentric orbit results\nin a strengthened and narrowed equatorial jet, westward winds at mid-latitudes,\nand a phase-dependent thermal inversion. The strength and magnitude of these\neffects scale with the chosen global magnetic field strength. We also generate\nhigh-resolution (R=100,000) emission spectra to study net Doppler shifts and\nfind inter-orbit spectroscopic variability at moderate magnetic field\nstrengths, as well as decreased Doppler broadening as magnetic field strengths\nincrease. This work represents the first time that the kinematic MHD approach\nhas been applied to an eccentric hot Jupiter and highlights the importance of a\nlocally calculated, temperature dependent magnetic drag prescription for\npredicting atmospheric structure and resulting spectra.\n","authors":["Hayley Beltz","Willow Houck","Laura C.

Recent observational surveys, including OSSOS++, have revealed that\ndynamically cold and hot TNO populations exhibit similar size distributions for\ndimmer objects ($H_r > 5$), which are consistent with planetesimal formation by\nstreaming instability (SI). However, the hot population contains a\nsignificantly larger number of massive bodies, including several dwarf planets.\nIn this study, we investigate the role of pebble accretion in shaping the size\ndistribution of hot TNOs, after their formation in the primordial disk (PB)\nbetween 20 and 30 au and before these bodies were dynamically implanted into\ntheir current orbits by a migrating Neptune. We find that pebble accretion\ngrows the most massive bodies only, consistent with the flattening of the\ndistribution brightwards of $H_r=5$. All results point to a correlation\n(degeneracy) between the pebble aerodynamic size and the intensity of the gas\nmotions. Nevertheless, accretion from an inward-drifting stream of pebbles is\nunlikely, as it puts extreme demands on the mass budget of pebbles. In\nparticular, the masses of the cold classicals are too low to trigger pebble\naccretion. Accretion in an environment where pebbles are entrained, as believed\nto be the case in ALMA rings, is preferable. Combining the constraints obtained\nfrom this study with ALMA imagery morphology fitting reveals a typical pebble\naerodynamic size of $\\tau_s \\sim 10^{-2}$, a turbulent diffusivity parameter\n$\\alpha_D\\sim10^{-3}$, and a total accreted pebble mass of ${\\sim}10\\,m_\\oplus$\nin the primordial belt.

The\nlocation of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray\nspectra from Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations of\n27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component\nis present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of SXVI K$\\alpha$,\nSiXIV K$\\alpha$, and NeX K$\\alpha$, which are the tell-tale signatures of the\nhot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27\ntargets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources\ndisplaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems.\nAdditionally, most of the detected lines are time-variable, reinforcing their\nlikely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the super-virial\ntemperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be\nlocated in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, in line with some recent\nsimulation results.\n","authors":["Manami Roy","Smita Mathur","Sanskriti Das","Armando Lara-DI","Yair Krongold","Anjali Gupta"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15394v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted in the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ), 4 Figures and 4 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04446v1","updated":"2025-02-06T19:00:06Z","published":"2025-02-06T19:00:06Z","title":"Enhancing the accuracy of observable distributions for galaxies\n  classified in the Projected Phase Space Diagram","summary":"  Studies of galaxy populations classified according to their kinematic\nbehaviours and dynamical state using the Projected Phase Space Diagram (PPSD)\nare affected by misclassification and contamination, leading to systematic\nerrors in determining the characteristics of the different galaxy classes.

For instance, these interactions play a pivotal\nrole in the cycling of baryons which fuels star formation. The transport and\ndynamics of cold clouds in their surrounding hot environment are governed by\ncomplex small scale processes (such as the interplay of turbulence and\nradiative cooling) that determine how the phases exchange mass, momentum and\nenergy. Large scale models thus require subgrid prescriptions in the form of\nmodels validated on small scale simulations, which often take the form of\ncoupled differential equations. In this work, we explore using neural ordinary\ndifferential equations which embed neural networks as terms in the model to\ncapture an uncertain physical process. We then apply Symbolic Regression to\npotentially discover new insights into the physics of cloud-environment\ninteractions. We test this on both generated mock data and actual simulation\ndata. We also extend the neural ODE to include a secondary neural term. We show\nthat neural ODEs in tandem with Symbolic Regression can be used to enhance the\naccuracy and efficiency of subgrid models, and/or discover the underlying\nequations to improve generality and scientific understanding.

We find that\ndwarf galaxies in the outer regions of the Fornax cluster have higher values of\nasymmetry compared to other dwarfs in the cluster, indicating a greater degree\nof morphological disturbances within dwarf galaxies in these regions. We also\nfind that galaxies in the very inner regions are more asymmetric than those\nfurther out. The A-magnitude relation reveals a trend where asymmetry increases\nas galaxies become fainter, and the A-colour relation shows that galaxies with\nbluer colours tend to exhibit higher asymmetry. We do not find any correlations\nwith smoothness, except that smoothness strongly decreases with stellar mass.\nWe propose that the higher asymmetry of dwarfs in the outer regions is most\nlikely caused by ram pressure stripping. In the very inner parts, the\nasymmetries most likely are caused by tidal effects.

In particular,\nwe focus on the study of the stream of Palomar 5, a well-known globular cluster\nin the Galactic halo, which has particularly long tidal tails. For this\npurpose, we used a particle-test code to simulate Palomar 5's tidal tails when\nsubjected to the Galaxy's gravitational field plus its whole system of globular\nclusters.

It has long been debated whether\ngalaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman\ncontinuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations\nslightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN\ncandidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs.\nHere we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization\nusing the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant\nionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of\nobjects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15\nand 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a\npoint-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV\nJWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an\nabsolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN\nsample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of $M_{\\rm UV} \\approx -15$\nmag.

In this\nmodel, the accretion stream from the secondary white dwarf in a double white\ndwarf binary strikes the primary white dwarf violently enough to trigger a\nhelium shell detonation, which in turn triggers a carbon/oxygen core\ndetonation. If the secondary white dwarf survives the primary's explosion, it\nwill be flung away as a hypervelocity star. While previous work has shown that\nthe hotter observed D6 stars can be broadly understood as secondaries whose\nouter layers have been heated by their primaries' explosions, the properties of\nthe cooler D6 stars have proven difficult to reproduce.

These neutrinos carry\n99\\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in\nunderstanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic\nObservatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a\nsodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next\ngalactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate\ndetectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae.

The low mass of the cryogenic\ndetectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc\nwithout pileup.

However, the dominant mechanism of mass\ntransfer from the red giant donor to the compact accretor - typically a white\ndwarf or, in rare cases, a neutron star - remains unclear. It is uncertain\nwhether it is driven primarily by the stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow, or a\ncombination of the two. While radii inferred from rotational velocities or\nspectral types suggest smaller Roche-lobe filling factors, the presence of\nellipsoidal variability, presumably caused by tidally deformed giants in many\nsymbiotic systems, indicates the opposite. Interferometric observations of\nsymbiotic giants, combined with distance measurements provided by the Gaia\nmission, offer a promising avenue to resolve this discrepancy.

Some theoretical\nmodels have predicted transient electromagnetic (EM) emission from these\nmergers, enabling the association of LISA GW sources with their EM counterparts\nvia telescope follow-up. However, the number of unrelated EM transients that\nmight contaminate telescope searches for the true transient counterparts of\nLISA MBH mergers is unknown. We investigate the expected numbers of unrelated\nEM transients that will coincide with simulated LISA localization volumes of\nMBH mergers, as a function of the merger total mass and redshift. We find that\nthe number of potential contaminants in LISA localization volumes drops to\nunity for mergers at $z \\lesssim 0.8$ and at 1 hour before coalescence. After\ncoalescence, the parameter space corresponding to a maximum of one potential\ncontaminant expands to $z \\lesssim 1.5$. In contrast, if the redshifts for all\ntransients detected in LISA sky localization regions are not available, the\nnumber of potential contaminants increases by an average factor of $\\sim100$,\nand never drops below unity. Overall, we expect the average number of\ncontaminating transients in telescope follow-up of LISA MBH mergers to be\nnon-negligible, especially without redshift information for the detected\ntransients. We recommend that endeavors designing follow-up strategies of LISA\nevents should focus on: (1) building large redshift catalogs for host galaxies,\n(2) developing robust real-time transient classification algorithms, (3) and\ncoordinating telescope resources to obtain redshifts for candidate transient EM\ncounterparts in a timely manner.\n","authors":["Weixiang Yu","John J.

One\nplausible scenario for primordial black hole (PBH) formation arises during the\npreheating stage following inflation. Notably, this scenario does not\nnecessitate any ad-hoc fine-tuning of the scalar field potential. This paper\nfocuses on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent\npossibility of PBH formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model\nfor inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is\nbased on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon\nduring inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different\nphases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain\nrange of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation\n(type II modes) but evolve identically to type I modes if they fall into the\ninstability band, leading to large density perturbation above the threshold and\ncan potentially also contribute to the PBH formation.

While strong constraints\nhave been established for pure fuzzy dark matter models, the more general\nscenario where ultra-light axions constitute only a fraction of the dark matter\nhas been limited to a few observational probes. In this work, we use the galaxy\ncluster number counts obtained from the first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) of the\nSRG/eROSITA mission together with gravitational weak lensing data from the Dark\nEnergy Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam, to constrain\nthe fraction of ultra-light axions in the mass range $10^{-32}$ eV to\n$10^{-24}$ eV. We put upper bounds on the ultra-light axion relic density in\nindependent logarithmic axion mass bins by performing a full cosmological\nparameter inference. We find an exclusion region in the intermediate\nultra-light axion mass regime with the tightest bounds reported so far in the\nmass bins around $m_\\mathrm{a}=10^{-27}$ eV with $\\Omega_\\mathrm{a} < 0.0036$\nand $m_\\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV with $\\Omega_\\mathrm{a} < 0.0084$, both at 95%\nconfidence level.

This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of\nspace-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted\nmass of seed BHs.

Two types of\nseed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\\bullet\\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\\odot$) formed\nin rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\\bullet\\sim\n10^{1-3}~M_\\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter\nhalos.

If $\\alpha$ Centauri ejects material at a rate comparable to\nour own Solar System, we estimate the current number of $\\alpha$ Centauri\nparticles larger than 100 m in diameter within our Oort Cloud to be $10^{6}$,\nand during $\\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach, this will increase by an\norder of magnitude. However, the observable fraction of such objects remains\nlow as there is only a probability of $10^{-6}$ that one of them is within 10\nau of the Sun. A small number ($\\sim 10$) meteors greater than 100 micrometers\nfrom $\\alpha$ Centauri may currently be entering Earth's atmosphere every year:\nthis number is very sensitive to the assumed ejected mass distribution, but the\nflux is expected to increase as $\\alpha$ Centauri approaches.\n","authors":["Cole R.

Aims. We aim to provide a snapshot of the forming protobinary\nsystem SVS13A, consisting of VLA4A and VLA4B.

We conducted ALMA observations toward SVS13A targeting CH3CN and\nCH3-13CN J=12-11 K-ladder line emission with a high spatial resolution of ~30\nau at a spectral resolution of ~0.08 km s-1 Results.

We find a possible infalling signature toward the bursting\nsecondary source VLA4A, which may be fed by an infalling streamer from the\nlarge-scale envelope. The mechanical heating in the binary system, as well as\nthe infalling shocked gas, likely play a role in the thermal structure of the\nprotobinary system.

The UV-optical spectrum is described by\ndust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at\n$\\lambda>4000$ A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray\nextinction curve at $\\lambda<3000$ A, due to the absence of small-size grains.\nThere is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light.

We used results from the Herschel Space Observatory\nDUNES and DEBRIS surveys of 295 nearby FGK dwarf stars imaged at 100 $\\mu$m and\n160 $\\mu$m. Most of the 48 debris discs in this sample have small optical\ndepths, making them more likely to be affected by the ISM compared to optically\nthick discs. Since the stars in our sample are located within the Local\nInterstellar Cloud, we can infer that their debris discs encounter similar\nconditions. This allows us to use the stellar space velocity as a single\nindicator of the forces that can act on the debris disc dust grains when they\ninteract with the ISM. The observed debris disc occurrence rates seem to depend\non the stellar space velocities, as expected under the hypothesis that stars\nwith higher space velocities have a higher probability of losing their\ncircumstellar dust. The percentage of sources with debris discs in our sample\nreaches a maximum of $\\approx$25% for stars with low space velocity component\nvalues, $|U_{\\mathrm{rel}}|$, relative to the local ISM, and decreases for\nlarger $|U_{\\mathrm{rel}}|$ values down to the 10% level. A decrease in the\naverage disc fractional luminosity as a function of $|U_{\\mathrm{rel}}|$ is\nalso observed. These dependences do not disappear after accounting for the\nreported higher dispersion of $U$ values with age. In extended discs, the\nimpact of the ISM could also explain the links observed between the stellar\nspace velocities and the debris disc projected ellipticities, position angles,\nand radii. Although these indications may not be fully conclusive on their own,\nthey collectively reinforce the hypothesis that the ISM influences the\noccurrence rates and morphologies of debris discs.\n","authors":["A.

We apply a\nrealistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary\npopulations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b)\ndynamical formation in star clusters.

They also serve\nas useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass\nratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral\ncan be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic\norbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence\nis determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of\nmotion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any\nmoment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a\n``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion.\nThis restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the\nbackreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body\napproaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and\nthe backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO,\nits trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly\nconnect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and\nthe final plunge.

Matching the equation of state\n(EoS) for the crust and core and obtaining a suitable description of these\nextreme conditions are crucial for understanding the properties of these\ncompact objects. In this work, we construct ten different NS EoSs incorporating\nthree distinct crust models, which are connected to the core using a\nthermodynamically and causally consistent formalism. For cold NSs, we propose a\nlinear relationship between pressure and energy density in a narrow region\nbetween the crust and core, effectively establishing an interpolation function\nin the pressure-baryonic chemical potential plane. We then compare this EoS\nmatching method with the classical approach, which neglects causal and\nthermodynamic consistency. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to\nobtain the mass-radius relationship and compare our results with observational\nconstraints on NSs. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the new\nmatching formalism on non-radial oscillation frequencies and damping times. Our\nfindings suggest that the method used to glue the crust and core EoS impacts NS\nobservables, such as the radius, oscillation frequencies, and damping times of\nnon-radial modes, which may be crucial for interpreting future gravitational\nwave observations from neutron star mergers or isolated pulsars. The effects\nare particularly noticeable for low-mass NSs, regardless of the specific EoS\nmodel chosen.

HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by\nspeckle noise originating from perturbations in Earth's atmosphere and\nimperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques\nare used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal.\nOften, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally\nsubtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable\nmachine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal\nfor one of the most used post-processing methods: principal component analysis\n(PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function\nfor high numbers of PCA components. This representation of the noise captures\nnot only the speckle noise but also the characteristic shape of the planet\nsignal. Building on these insights, we develop a new post-processing method\n(4S) that constrains the noise model to minimize this signal loss. We apply our\nmodel to 11 archival HCI datasets from the VLT-NACO instrument in the L'-band\nand find that our model consistently outperforms PCA. The improvement is\nlargest at close separations to the star ($\\leq 4 \\lambda /D$) providing up to\n1.5 magnitudes deeper contrast.

With the majority of exoplanet-host stars\nhaving only atmospheric constraints available, robust inference of their\nparameters is susceptible to the approach used. The goal of this work is to\ndevelop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar\nradius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age\ndistribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach\ninvolves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest,\nExtra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of\nstellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and\nluminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the\ninferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and\nLEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars\nhosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our\nmachine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias\n(and a scatter) of -0.5\\% (5\\%) and -0.2\\% (2\\%) in radius, 6\\% (5\\%) per cent\nand -2\\% (3\\%) in mass, and -9\\% (16\\%) and 7\\% (23\\%) in age, respectively.\nTherefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic\ninferences.

At large scales, these features provide a\nunique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived\nfrom Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial\nfluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial\nfeatures would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they\nare expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated\nN-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while\noscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of\nprimordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure\nformation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in\nthe matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be\nused to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern\nin the halo mass function.

Recent mass\nmeasurements of disks around protostars suggest an early start of planet\nformation in the Class 0/I disks. However, dust substructures, one possible\nsignature of forming planets, are rarely observed in the young Class 0/I disks,\nwhile they are ubiquitous in the mature Class II disks. It is not clear whether\nthe lack of dust substructures in the Class 0/I disks indicates absence of\nplanets or whether it is due to other physical effects such as temperature and\ndust opacity. Here we consider the effect of temperature on the ability of\nplanets to produce dust substructures. We prescribe the evolution of the disk\nand the protostar from Class 0 to Class II phase and calculate the disk\ntemperature using radiative transfer models at various stages of the evolution.\nWe use the mid-plane temperature to calculate the disk scale height and the\nminimum planet mass needed to open observable dust gaps using the thermal\ncriterion.

HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by\nspeckle noise originating from perturbations in Earth's atmosphere and\nimperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques\nare used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal.\nOften, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally\nsubtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable\nmachine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal\nfor one of the most used post-processing methods: principal component analysis\n(PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function\nfor high numbers of PCA components.

We advocate an idea that the dark matter in form\nof the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons\n(similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate\nthe required power. The corresponding macroscopically large object in form of\nthe AQN behaves as {\\it chameleon}: it does not interact with the surrounding\nmaterial in dilute environment and serves as perfect cold DM candidate.\nHowever, AQN becomes strongly interacting object in sufficiently dense\nenvironment. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL\nphysics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed\nsimilarity $\\Omega_{\\rm DM}\\sim \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$ between visible and DM\ncomponents. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework,\nnot sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set\nof parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key\nelements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering\nthe BL events.

The goal of this work is to\ndevelop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar\nradius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age\ndistribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach\ninvolves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest,\nExtra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of\nstellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and\nluminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the\ninferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and\nLEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars\nhosting giant planets.

Aims.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the gravitational interactions\nexerted by a compact and eccentric binary system on the circumbinary and\ncircumprimary discs, and the resulting transport of gas and solids between the\ndisc components. Methods. We assume that the gas in the system behaves as a\nfluid and model its evolution by means of high resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Dust grains are modeled as Lagrangian particles that interact with\nthe gas and the stars. Results. Models indicate that significant fluxes of gas\nand dust proceed from the circumbinary disc toward the circumprimary disc. For\nthe applied system parameters, grains of certain sizes are segregated outside\nthe tidal gap generated by the stars. Consequently, the size distribution of\nthe transported dust is not continuous but it presents a gap in the mm size\nrange. In close binaries, the lifetime of an isolated circumprimary disc is\nfound to be short, approximately 10 5 years, because of its small mass.\nHowever, because of the influx of gas from beyond the tidal gap, the disc\naround the primary star can survive much longer, about 10 6 years, as long as\ngas accretion from the circumbinary disc continues. The supply of solids and\nthe extended lifetime of a circumbinary disc also aids in the possible\nformation of giant planets. Compared to close binary systems without a\ncircumbinary disc, we expect a higher frequency of single- or multiple- planet\nsystems. Additionally, a planetesimal or debris belt can form in proximity of\nthe truncation radius of the circumprimary disc and/or around the location of\nthe exterior edge of the tidal gap.\n","authors":["Francesco Marzari","Gennaro D'Angelo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02134v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted for publication on Astronomy and Astrophysics"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02124v1","updated":"2025-02-04T09:00:15Z","published":"2025-02-04T09:00:15Z","title":"From Streaming Instability to the Onset of Pebble Accretion I.\n  Investigating the Growth Modes in Planetesimal Rings","summary":"  Context.

The formation of planetary embryos from\nfilaments during the disk lifetime is possible but strongly dependent on the\nseparation from the star and the mass of the host star.

In this paper, we analyze both numerical\nsimulations of disk galaxies and observational data to study the effect of\nbar-spiral physical overlap on stellar radial migration and star formation in\nthe bar vicinity, as a function of time and galactic azimuth. We study three\ndifferent numerical models, two of which are in a cosmological context, as well\nas APOGEE DR17 data and the WISE catalog of Galactic HII regions. We find that\nperiodic boosts in stellar radial migration occur when the bar and spiral\nstructure overlap. This mechanism causes net inward migration along the bar\nleading side, while stars along the bar trailling side and minor axis are\nshifted outward. The signature of bar-spiral induced migration is seen between\nthe bar's inner Lindbald resonance and well outside its corotation, beyond\nwhich other drivers take over. We also find that, in agreement with\nsimulations, APOGEE DR17 stars born at the bar vicinity (mostly metal-rich) can\nmigrate out to the solar radius while remaining on cold orbits. For the Milky\nWay, 13% of stars in the solar vicinity were born inside the bar, compared to\n5-20% in the simulations. Bar-spiral reconnections also result in periodic\nstarbursts at the bar ends with an enhancement of up to a factor of 4,\ndepending on the strength of the spiral structure. Similarly to the migration\nbursts, these do not always happen simultaneously at the two sides of the bar,\nhinting at the importance of odd spiral modes.

Our\nkey aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected\nabundance of bright galaxies at $z \\geq 11$, as well as their metal enrichment\nand spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources\nof reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation\nefficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics\nsimulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark\nmatter halos and their baryonic components from $z \\sim 4.5-40$. In addition,\nwe explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at $z \\geq\n11$: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy\nwith decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star\nformation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our\nkey findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance\nof bright galaxies at $z \\geq 11$; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important\nrole for the bright-end of the UV LF at $z \\leq 11$; (iii) the mass-metallicity\nrelation is in place as early as $z \\sim 17$ in all models although its slope\nis model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all\nof our models are in good agreement with current estimates of $\\beta$ slopes at\n$z \\sim 5-17$ and Balmer break strengths at $z \\sim 6-10$; (v) in the eIMF\nmodel, galaxies at $z\\geq12$ or with $\\rm{M_{UV}}\\geq-18$ show values of\n$\\xi_{\\rm{ion}} \\sim 10^{25.55}~{\\rm [Hz~erg^{-1}]}$, twice larger than in\nother models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below $10^{9}\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ is\nthe key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk ($\\sim 85\\%$) of ionising\nphotons down to its midpoint at $z \\sim 7$.\n","authors":["Valentin Mauerhofer","Pratika Dayal","Martin G.

A key\ncomponent of MCs are photodissociation regions (PDRs), where far-ultraviolet\nradiation plays a crucial role in determining the gas's physical and chemical\nstate. Traditional PDR models assume chemical steady state (CSS), where the\nrates of H$_2$ formation and photodissociation are balanced. However, real MCs\nare dynamic and can be out of CSS. In this study, we demonstrate that combining\nH$_2$ emission lines observed in the far-ultraviolet or infrared with column\ndensity observations can be used to derive the rates of H$_2$ formation and\nphotodissociation. We derive analytical formulae that relate these rates to\nobservable quantities, which we validate using synthetic H$_2$ line emission\nmaps derived from the SILCC-Zoom hydrodynamical simulation. Our method\nestimates integrated H$_2$ formation and dissociation rates with an accuracy\n$\\approx 30$ % (on top of uncertainties in observed H$_2$ emission maps and\ncolumn densities). Our simulations, valid for column densities $N \\leq 2 \\times\n10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, cover a wide dynamic range in H$_2$ formation and\nphotodissociation rates, showing significant deviations from CSS, with 74 % of\nthe MC's mass deviating from CSS by a factor greater than 2. Our analytical\nformulae can effectively distinguish between regions in and out of CSS. When\napplied to actual H$_2$ line observations, our method can assess the chemical\nstate of MCs, providing insights into their evolutionary stages and lifetimes.\nA NASA Small Explorer mission concept, Eos, will be proposed in 2025 and is\nspecifically designed to conduct the types of observations outlined in this\nstudy.\n","authors":["Shmuel Bialy","Blakesley Burkhart","Daniel Seifried","Amiel Sternberg","Benjamin Godard","Mark R.

Our work highlights three\n$2<z<3$ dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical\ndusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint\nsources with significant probability of lying above $z>15$, with best-fit\nmasses compatible with $\\Lambda$CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion\nefficiency.

Similarly to\ncosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing\nfronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not\nbe spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming\n21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will\ncontain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However,\nextracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of\ninstrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to\nreconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we\nextract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical\nAP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to\nconstrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\\text{A}}$ and\nHubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\\sim 2\\%$ precision,\nrobustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models\ntested here.

In this work, we\npresent evidence that resonant dragging by the corotation of a decelerating bar\ncould be the main driver of radial migration in the Milky Way disc. Using a\ntest particle simulation, we demonstrate this scenario explains the two\ndistinct age-metallicity sequences observed in the solar vicinity: the\nplateauing upper sequence is interpreted as stars dragged outwards by the\nexpanding corotation of the decelerating bar and the steeper lower sequence as\nstars formed locally around the solar circle. The upper migrated sequence\ndominates at guiding radii around the current corotation radius of the bar,\n$R\\sim7\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, but rapidly dies away beyond this where the mechanism\ncannot operate. This behaviour naturally explains the radial dependence of the\n$\\mathrm{[\\alpha/Fe]}$-bimodality, in particular the truncation of the\nhigh-$\\mathrm{[\\alpha/Fe]}$ disc beyond the solar circle. Under our proposed\nradial migration scenario, we constrain the Milky Way bar's pattern speed\nevolution using the age-metallicity distribution of stars currently trapped at\ncorotation.

However, even if a given\nsimulation reproduces the integrated properties of galaxies well, it may not\nreproduce the detailed structures of individual galaxies. Comparisons between\nthe 2D light distributions of simulated and observed galaxies -- particularly\nin the dwarf regime, where key processes like tidal perturbations and baryonic\nfeedback most strongly influence galaxy structure -- thus provide an additional\nvaluable test of the simulation's efficacy. We compare scaling relations\nderived from mock observations of simulated galaxies, drawn from the two\nlargest halos in the high-resolution NewHorizon cosmological simulation, with\ngalaxies in the Fornax cluster. While Fornax is significantly more massive than\neither group, it is the lowest-mass cluster in the local Universe, and contains\na well-studied population of spatially resolved dwarfs, hence serves as a\nuseful benchmark. Per unit stellar mass, NewHorizon dwarfs are systematically\nlarger in half-light radius, much fainter in surface brightness, and bluer in\ncolour than their Fornax counterparts, albeit with similar light profile\nshapes. We discuss potential reasons for these discrepancies, including\nenvironmental effects, baryonic feedback, resolution, or couplings of these\nfactors. As observations of dwarfs outside of the local Universe become more\nplentiful through on-going or up-coming surveys such as Euclid and LSST, 2D\ncomparisons such as these, where properties are measured in the same way across\nboth simulations and observations, can place strong constraints on processes\nthat alter the spatial distribution of baryons in galaxies.\n","authors":["Aaron Watkins","Garreth Martin","Sugata Kaviraj","Chris Collins","Yohan Dubois","Katarina Kraljic","Christophe Pichon","Sukyoung K.

Cosmic rays, with their\nsubstantial energy density, influence the interstellar medium (ISM) by\nsupporting galactic winds, modulating star formation, and shaping ISM\nenergetics. The simulations incorporate a multi-phase ISM, self-consistent CR\ntransport in the advection-diffusion approximation, and interactions with\nmagnetic fields to study their effect on galaxy evolution. Key findings reveal\nthat CRs reduce star formation rates, and drive weak but sustained outflows\nwith mass loading factors of $\\sim0.2$, transporting a substantial fraction\n(20%-60%) of the injected CR energy. These CR-driven outflows are launched not\njust from the galactic center but across the entire disk, illustrating their\npervasive dynamical influence. Galactic disks supported by CRs exhibit broader\nvertical structures compared to magnetic-field-dominated setups, though the\nscale heights are similar.

In particular,\n'chromosome maps' (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to\nidentify the first and second generation stars (1G and 2G) over the wide-field\nof view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an\nanalyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G\nfraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs either have a flat\ndistribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars.

It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions\n(hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost\ncluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial\ndistribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only\nless massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that\nfeature.

Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation\nefficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV\nluminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting\nmagnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst\nresulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift\ngalaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions,\nmaking the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between\nstar formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies.\nAlso, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an\noverabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal\nenrichment.

The high gas\nsurface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with\nthe gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil\ndrives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum\nwith respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\\Phi_{\\rm\ntot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the\nfeedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\\rm gas}$. At its most\nextreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\\rm\ngas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\\approx 5$ kpc and\n$\\vert z\\vert \\approx 1$ kpc within $\\Phi_{\\rm tot}(R,\\phi,z)$. Consistent with\nobservations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\\rm disc}\\gtrsim 50$%)\nwithin $R_s=2.2 R_{\\rm disc}$, where $R_{\\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc\nscale length. For a lower $f_{\\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing\namplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which\nunbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being\ndynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population.\nThe 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in\n$\\vert z\\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc.\nSuch a disc has enhanced [$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but\nno radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the\nMilky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a\nstationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.\n","authors":["Joss Bland-Hawthorn","Thor Tepper-Garcia","Oscar Agertz","Christoph Federrath","Misha Haywood","Paola di Matteo","Timothy R Bedding","Takafumi Tsukui","Emily Wisnioski","Melissa Ness","Ken Freeman"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01895v1.pdf","comment":"ApJ, 27 pages, 16 figures - simulations at\n  http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/turbo_disks - comments welcome as always"}],"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02742v1","updated":"2025-02-04T22:04:52Z","published":"2025-02-04T22:04:52Z","title":"Intersecting frontiers for ground and space-based solar missions:\n  symbiotic coordination between DKIST, PSP, and Solar Orbiter","summary":"  Three uniquely powerful solar and heliospheric facilities are now operational\nat the same time.

The \"textbook\" example of an\nepisodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal\nlaboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme\nenvironment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST\nobservations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure\nWR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper\nmotions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF\nsubtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and\ncarefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 $\\mu$m, through the\nbright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell\nproper motion of $390\\pm29$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which equates to a projected\nvelocity of $2714\\pm188$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1.64 kpc.

Our observations not only prove that these\ndusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and\noriginate from WR140, but also confirm the \"clumpy\" morphology of the dust\nshells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for\nat least 14 months from one cycle to the next.

The goal of this work is to\ndevelop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar\nradius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age\ndistribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach\ninvolves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest,\nExtra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of\nstellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and\nluminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the\ninferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and\nLEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars\nhosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our\nmachine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias\n(and a scatter) of -0.5\\% (5\\%) and -0.2\\% (2\\%) in radius, 6\\% (5\\%) per cent\nand -2\\% (3\\%) in mass, and -9\\% (16\\%) and 7\\% (23\\%) in age, respectively.\nTherefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic\ninferences. When applying our model to a sample of stars hosting Jupiter-mass\nplanets, we find the average age estimates for the hosts of Hot Jupiters, Warm\nJupiters, and Cold Jupiters to be 1.98, 2.98, and 3.51 Gyr, respectively. These\nstatistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on\nstellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the\naverage age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are\nstatistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.\n","authors":["Juma Kamulali","Benard Nsamba","Vardan Adibekyan","Achim Weiss","Tiago L.

Although MSPs are thought to originate in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, and\nothers are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding\nhow these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of\nneutron stars (NSs).\n  We studied the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order\nphase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigated\nwhether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as\nneutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, leaves an observable long-lasting\nimprint on the orbit.\n  We simulated mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass\nmain-sequence companion and followed the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and\nspin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we\nassumed a multi-polytrope equation of state that allows for a sharp phase\ntransition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational\nconstraints.\n  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe\noverflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition can occur\nduring the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this\ntransition can take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric\nbinary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick, then the\nbinary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or re-configured into\nan ultra-wide orbit.\n  Our findings suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for\nforming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the\norbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long orbital periods\n(> 50 d) could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense\nnuclear matter.\n","authors":["S.

In this work, we constructed a strong jet\nsample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL\nLac objects and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects to explore\nthe origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud\nactive galactic nucleus with a powerful jet toward the observer, causing their\nbroadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect,\nwe obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the fundamental plane (FP)\nof black hole activity for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray\ncorrelation is $L_{\\rm{R,int}}\\propto L_{\\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the\njet-dominated mode, the intrinsic FP is $\\log L_{\\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\\pm0.06)\\log\nL_{\\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\\pm0.10)\\log M_{\\rm{BH}}-(3.77\\pm2.11)$, which can be\ninterpreted by the hybrid mode of jet+standard disk.

New theories about the cores of\nneutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the\nneutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no\nmajor mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically\nprimordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter\nbefore. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime\nof the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to\nThe Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black\nholes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in\ndense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and\nSupermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence.

During the flare, the optical polarization drops from\n~1.4% to ~0.5%, indicating the emergence of an unpolarized component. We\npropose that the thickening of the disc, which enlarges the shock region\nbetween the pulsar wind and the accretion flow and may drive the X-ray flaring\nobserved in tMSPs, enhances the ionization level of the disc, thereby\ngenerating an increased number of free electrons. These electrons could then be\nchannelled by magnetic field lines into the jet. This increased jet\nmass-loading could drive the associated radio and optical variability. The\nradio spectral evolution during flares is consistent with synchrotron\nself-absorption in jet ejecta or internal shocks within the compact jet.

We\nperformed a homogeneous analysis of the RV time series of 200 M dwarfs observed\nwith HARPS from 2003 to 2019 (gathering more than 15000 spectra), with the aim\nof understanding detectable signals such as stellar and planetary companions\nand activity signals. The RVs were computed with a template matching method\nbefore carrying out the time series analysis. First, we focused on the\nsystematic analysis of the presence of a dominant long-term pattern in the RV\ntime series (linear or quadratic trend and sine function). Then, we analysed\nhigher-frequency perdiodic signals using periodograms of the residual time\nseries and Keplerian function fitting. We found long-term variability in 57 RV\ntime series (28.5%). This led to the revision of the parameters of the massive\nplanet (GJ9482 b), as well as the detection of four substellar and stellar\ncompanions (around GJ3307, GJ4001, GJ4254, andGJ9588), for which we\ncharacterised inclinations and masses by combining RV and astrometry. The\nperiodic analysis allowed us to recover 97% of the planetary systems already\npublished in this sample, but also to propose three new planetary candidates\norbiting GJ300 (7.3Me), GJ654(5Me), and GJ739 (39Me), which require additional\nmeasurements before they can be confirmed.\n","authors":["L.

The difference\nbetween these two estimates is remarkable. This raises the question of whether\nthe diverging temporal evolution of these indicators could be due to changes in\nthe spectral composition of outdoor artificial light, consequence of the\ncurrent process of replacement of lighting technologies. This paper presents a\nmodel for evaluating the temporal rate of change of different light pollution\nindicators and applies it to the VIIRS-DNB vs GAN issue, based on available\ndata. The results show that the reported difference could be explained by\nspectral changes alone, if the visual GAN observations are made with scotopic\nor mesopic adaptation at definite times under some particular transition\nconditions. In case of photopic adapted observers, however, reconciling these\ntwo measurement sets requires the existence of GAN-specific light sources that\naffect the Globe at Night observations but do not show up in the VIIRS-DNB\ndata. The lumen emissions of these GAN-specific sources for photopic observers\nshould increase at a rate larger than 9%/yr worldwide.\n","authors":["Salvador Bará","José J.

This\ncan be easily accomplished by applying a pulsed voltage to the pusher electrode\nwhile the ionizer is continuously flowing ions. This method is preferred for\nits simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here\nwe employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate,\nwhich is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The\nbenefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the\nstart of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly\nadvantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable. In this study, we\nused analytical and numerical methods to design a new bunching ionizer with\nreduced resources, adopting the principle of electrostatic ion beam trap. The\ntest model experimentally demonstrated the bunching performance with respect to\nsample gas density and ion bunching time using gas samples and electron impact\nionization. We also conducted an experiment in connection with a miniature\nTOF-MS, and showed that the sensitivity was improved by more than one order of\nmagnitude using the newly developed ionizer. Since the device is capable of\nbunching ions with lower voltage and lower power consumption (~100 V, ~0.8 W)\ncompared with conventional RF ion trap bunchers (several kilovolts, ~10 W), it\nwill be possible to find applications in portable mass spectrometer with\nreduced resources.\n","authors":["Oya Kawashima","Satoshi Kasahara","Yoshifumi Saito","Masafumi Hirahara","Kazushi Asamura","Shoichiro Yokota"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18006v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10515v2","updated":"2025-02-10T19:06:46Z","published":"2024-11-15T18:13:04Z","title":"Towards cosmological inference on unlabeled out-of-distribution HI\n  observational data","summary":"  We present an approach that can be utilized in order to account for the\ncovariate shift between two datasets of the same observable with different\ndistributions.

We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4\ntemperature and polarization trispectrum for $\\ell\\in[2,2048]$. Using the\ntheoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search\nfor 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary\nself-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial\nnon-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological\namplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of\noptimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly\ncompetitive. For example, we find $\\sigma(g_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=4.8\\times 10^4$\nand $\\tau_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc} <1500$ (95\\% CL), a factor of two improvement on\nEffective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\\sigma$ detection of gravitational\nlensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as\ndirection-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological\ncollider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of\nvalidation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics\nare found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between\nsimulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended\nto future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even\nhigher sensitivity.\n","authors":["Oliver H. E.

The\nproperties of said populations vary depending on the algorithm used to find\nthem, which is concerning as it may bias key statistics. We compare how the\npredicted (sub)halo mass functions, satellite radial distributions and\ncorrelation functions vary across algorithms in the dark-matter-only and\nhydrodynamical versions of the FLAMINGO simulations. We test three\nrepresentative approaches to finding subhaloes: grouping particles in\nconfiguration- (Subfind), phase- (ROCKSTAR and VELOCIraptor) and history-space\n(HBT-HERONS). We also present HBT-HERONS, a new version of the HBT+ subhalo\nfinder that improves the tracking of subhaloes. We find 10%-level differences\nin the $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}$ mass function, reflecting different field halo\ndefinitions and occasional miscentering. The bound mass functions can differ by\n75% at the high mass end, even when using the maximum circular velocity as a\nmass proxy. The number of well-resolved subhaloes differs by up to 20% near\n$R_{\\mathrm{200c}}$, reflecting differences in the assignment of mass to\nsubhaloes and their identification. The predictions of different subhalo\nfinders increasingly diverge towards the centres of the host haloes. The\nperformance of most subhalo finders does not improve with the resolution of the\nsimulation and is worse for hydrodynamical than for dark-matter-only\nsimulations. We conclude that HBT-HERONS is the preferred choice of subhalo\nfinder due to its low computational cost, self-consistently made and robust\nmerger trees, and robust subhalo identification capabilities.\n","authors":["Victor J.

We show that a dusty trail associated with the brown dwarf\ncould be observable if dust within it is larger than that in the ambient\nmolecular cloud. For example, if the ambient cloud has a standard\n$\\sim0.25$$\\mu$m maximum grain size and the trail contains micron-sized grains,\nthen the trail will have a scattering opacity over an order of magnitude larger\ncompared to the surroundings in NIRCam short-wavelength filters. We use a\nsimple model to show that a change in maximum grain size can reproduce the high\n$A_V$ and the multi-filter NIRCam contrast seen between the trail and its\nsurroundings.

The radial velocity (RV) method remains the\nmost appropriate for such a census as it is sensitive to the widest ranges of\nmasses and periods. HARPS, mounted on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla\nObservatory (ESO, Chile), has been obtaining velocity measurements since 2003,\nand can therefore be used to analyse a very large and homogeneous dataset. We\nperformed a homogeneous analysis of the RV time series of 200 M dwarfs observed\nwith HARPS from 2003 to 2019 (gathering more than 15000 spectra), with the aim\nof understanding detectable signals such as stellar and planetary companions\nand activity signals. The RVs were computed with a template matching method\nbefore carrying out the time series analysis. First, we focused on the\nsystematic analysis of the presence of a dominant long-term pattern in the RV\ntime series (linear or quadratic trend and sine function). Then, we analysed\nhigher-frequency perdiodic signals using periodograms of the residual time\nseries and Keplerian function fitting. We found long-term variability in 57 RV\ntime series (28.5%). This led to the revision of the parameters of the massive\nplanet (GJ9482 b), as well as the detection of four substellar and stellar\ncompanions (around GJ3307, GJ4001, GJ4254, andGJ9588), for which we\ncharacterised inclinations and masses by combining RV and astrometry. The\nperiodic analysis allowed us to recover 97% of the planetary systems already\npublished in this sample, but also to propose three new planetary candidates\norbiting GJ300 (7.3Me), GJ654(5Me), and GJ739 (39Me), which require additional\nmeasurements before they can be confirmed.\n","authors":["L.

Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an\noptimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection.\nThe KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring\nthe radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES\nspectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the\nhabitable zone of their system. In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to\ncharacterize planetary signals in the K7V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to\nconstrain the planetary population within its habitable zone. We used 82\nCARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a GLS periodogram\nto search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with\nKeplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian\nframework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative\nconfigurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS\nsectors in search of planetary signals. We identified two signals: at 8.5d and\n29.7d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other\nnon-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80+/-0.76ME and\n12.4+/-1.1ME, corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a\nhigh certainty (>99.7%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time\nseries to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5ME within the\nhabitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose\norigin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1sigma with a transit\nfrom planet c. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this\nsystem, concluding that nulling interferometry with the LIFE mission could be\ncapable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres\nin future studies.\n","authors":["O.

Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic\nemission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold\nstars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In\nthis paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for\nthis new discovery engine operating in the K-dark passband, why we choose to\ndeploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as\na Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation.\n","authors":["Mansi M.

Here, we present the first transmission spectra of\nTOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet\n($M_p=1.08~\\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We\nobtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared\nSpectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. Our data reveal significant\nstellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing\nevents and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer\nwavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from\nunocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at\nwavelengths $\\lambda\\lesssim3.0$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the\npresence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination\nalso prevented the definitive detection of any $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, which has\nprimary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength\ncoverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ and\n$\\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um.\nOur gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with\nboth sub-solar metallicity ($\\log\\mathrm{[M/H]}\\sim-2$ for a clear atmosphere)\nand super-solar C/O ratio ($\\log\\mathrm{[C/O]}\\sim3$ for a clear or cloudy\natmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that\npredict a bulk metallicity of 10--20%, which is $\\sim100\\times$ the atmospheric\nmetallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is\ndecoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.\n","authors":["Caleb I.

Evolution of the CO luminosity function and the molecular\n  gas mass density out to $z$ ~ 6","summary":"  Cold molecular gas, largely traced by CO emission, is the primary fuel for\nstar formation, making it essential for understanding galaxy evolution. ALMA\nhas made significant progress in the study of the cosmic evolution of cold\nmolecular gas. Here, we exploit the ALMACAL survey to address issues relating\nto small sample sizes and cosmic variance, utilising calibration data from ALMA\nto compile a statistically significant and essentially unbiased sample of\nCO-selected galaxies. By employing a novel statistical approach to\nemission-line classification using semi-analytical models, we place strong\nconstraints on the CO luminosity function and the cosmic evolution of molecular\ngas mass density ($\\rho_{H_2}$) back to $z \\sim 6$. The cosmic molecular gas\nmass density increases with redshift, peaking around $z \\sim 1.5$, then slowly\ndeclines towards higher redshifts by $\\sim 1$ dex. Our findings confirm the key\nrole of molecular gas in fuelling star formation. The new $\\rho_{H_2}$\nestimates allow us to revisit the cosmic baryon cycle, showing that the ratio\nof molecular gas-to-stellar mass density is consistent with the so-called\n'bathtub model' of baryons, which implies a continuous replenishment of gas.\nThe cosmic gas depletion timescale, estimated on a global scale, is shown to be\nfairly constant at all redshifts. We emphasise the importance of surveys using\nmultiple small fields rather than a single contiguous area to mitigate the\neffects of cosmic variance.\n","authors":["Victoria Bollo","Céline Péroux","Martin Zwaan","Aleksandra Hamanowicz","Jianhang Chen","Simon Weng","Claudia del P.

The metallicity dependence of the distribution of old\nMW stars in the [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] enables the distinction of at least two\npopulations in terms of their star formation histories: a rapidly evolved\npopulation likely associated with the main progenitor system of the proto-MW;\nand populations characterised by less efficient, slower, star formation. In the\nSolar neighbourhood less efficient star forming populations are dominated by\nthe $Gaia$-$Enceladus$/$Sausage$ accretion debris. In the inner Galaxy, they\nare largely associated with the $Heracles$ structure.

The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey\nobserved the Galactic bulge and adjacent disk for several years, providing\nmulti-epoch, near-infrared images for 41 Galactic GCs. Detecting RRLyrae\nvariables belonging to these GCs will aid in their accurate parameterization.\nBy fully leveraging the astrometric, photometric, and variability VVV catalogs,\nwe searched for RRLyrae stars associated with GCs. Our selection criteria,\nbased on proper motions, proximity to the cluster centers, and distances\ninferred from their period-luminosity-metallicity relations, enable us to\naccurately identify the RRLyrae population in these GCs and determine color\nexcesses and distances in a homogeneous manner. Since the VVV catalogs cover\nfrom the innermost regions of the GCs to their outskirts, we can provide a\ncomprehensive picture of the entire RRLyrae population in these GCs. We have\ndiscovered significant RRLyrae populations in two highly reddened Galactic GCs:\nUKS1 and VVV-CL160, previously unknown to host RRLyrae stars. Additionally, we\nhave detected one RRLyrae candidate in each of Terzan4 and Terzan9, also new to\nRRLyrae detection. We further confirm and increase the number of RRLyrae stars\ndetected in 22 other low-latitude Galactic GCs. The RRLyrae distances place\nmost of these GCs within the Galactic bulge, aligning well with the few GCs in\nour sample with reliable Gaia or Hubble Space Telescope measurements. However,\nmost of the VVV GCs lack accurate Gaia distances, and literature distances are\ngenerally significantly smaller than those derived in this work. As a byproduct\nof our analysis, we have obtained the proper motions for all the VVV GCs,\nindependently confirming Gaia results, except for UKS1 and 2MASS-GC02.\n","authors":["Javier Alonso-García","Leigh C.

Filament identification and\n  their properties","summary":"  As the environment harbouring the majority of galaxies, filaments are thought\nto play a key role in the co-evolution of galaxies and the cosmic web. In this\nfirst part of a series to understand the link between galaxies and filaments\nthrough cosmological simulations, we address two major current obstacles on\nthis path: the difficulty of meaningful filament identification, and their\npoorly constrained properties and internal structure. We use the public EAGLE\nand TNG100 simulations to build physically motivated filament catalogues with\nthe DisPerSE algorithm, based on the dark matter (DM) field at redshift z = 0\nand z = 2, explicitly accounting for the multi-scale nature of filaments and\nwith careful validation of results. Filament widths, lengths, and densities\nvary by factors ~5-100 in both simulations, highlighting the heterogeneous\nnature of filaments as a cosmic environment. All filaments are relatively thin,\nwith overdensity profiles of galaxies, DM, and gas dropping to the cosmic mean\nwithin <3 Mpc from their spines. Contrary to groups and clusters, filament\ncores are highly substructure dominated, by as much as ~80 per cent. Filament\ngas maps reveal rich temperature and density structures that limit the\napplicability of simple cylindrically symmetric models. EAGLE and TNG100 agree\nthat z = 2 filament spines are traced by overdense cool gas in pressure\nequilibrium with a >10x hotter envelope. However, significant differences in\ndetail between their predicted gas property maps imply that individual\nsimulations cannot yet describe the baryon structure of filaments with\ncertainty. Finally, we compare our fiducial filament network to one constructed\nfrom galaxies. The two differ in many aspects, but the distance of a galaxy to\nits nearest galaxy-based filament still serves as a statistical proxy for its\ntrue environment.\n","authors":["Yannick M.

As such,\nthey are regarded as the most highly ionised component of Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN). For decades, it was thought that they were only formed in the\ninner portions of the narrow line region (NLR). Nowadays, due to the larger\nsensitivity of the detectors and the availability of integral field unit (IFU)\nspectrographs, that emission in addition to the nuclear component is found to\nbe extended up to a few kiloparsecs away from the active centre. In this\nreview, we highlight the most important aspects of the coronal emission and\ndiscuss the recent developments in the field.

It provides the ingredient for star\nformation, and sensitively traces the internal processes and external\nperturbations influencing the galaxy. With the beginning of many new radio\ntelescopes and surveys, HI may make a more significant contribution to the\nunderstanding of galaxies in the near future. This review discusses the major\ndevelopment of the $21\\,\\text{cm}$ emission-line HI observations and studies in\nthe past few years, including its scaling relations with other galaxy\nproperties, its kinematics and structures, its role in environmental studies,\nand its constraints on hydrodynamical simulations. The local-Universe HI\nscaling relations of stellar-mass--selected samples extend smoothly to\n$10^9\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$ stellar mass, with a tentative evolution to the redshift\nof ${\\sim}0.1$. The development of measurement techniques enables better\nestimations of HI non-circular motion, dispersion, and thickness, and new\nobservations revealed extended or extra-planar HI structures, both helpfully\nconstraining the gas accretion, stellar feedback, and star formation processes\nof galaxy evolution models. HI is very useful for tracing the on-going\nsatellite evolution in dense environments, the studies of which would benefit\nfrom ongoing blind HI surveys.

This will allow the detailed\nstudy of mass, metallicity, and stellar populations across galaxies, which will\nconstrain their formation and evolutionary pathways. Transforming the Euclid\nimaging for large samples of galaxies into maps of physical parameters in an\nefficient and reliable manner is an outstanding challenge. We investigate the\npower and reliability of machine learning techniques to extract the\ndistribution of physical parameters within well-resolved galaxies. We focus on\nestimating stellar mass surface density, mass-averaged stellar metallicity and\nage. We generate noise-free, synthetic high-resolution imaging data in the\nEuclid photometric bands for a set of 1154 galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological\nsimulation. The images are generated with the SKIRT radiative transfer code,\ntaking into account the complex 3D distribution of stellar populations and\ninterstellar dust attenuation. We use a machine learning framework to map the\nidealised mock observational data to the physical parameters on a\npixel-by-pixel basis. We find that stellar mass surface density can be\naccurately recovered with a $\\leq 0.130 {\\rm \\,dex}$ scatter. Conversely,\nstellar metallicity and age estimates are, as expected, less robust, but still\ncontain significant information which originates from underlying correlations\nat a sub-kpc scale between stellar mass surface density and stellar population\nproperties.\n","authors":[" Euclid Collaboration","I.

X. The 6196 Å diffuse interstellar band:\n  Identification of side DIBs as indication for a small carrier molecule","summary":"  Context: Numerous studies of diffuse interstellar band (DIB) profiles have\ndetected substructures, implying large molecules as their carriers. However,\nsome of the narrowest DIBs generally do not show such substructure, suggesting\nthe possibility of very small carriers. Aims: Based on the previously found\ntight correlation of the three narrow DIBs at 6196, 6440 and 6623 A and the\npresent detection of weaker side DIBs to each of them in the extensive data set\nfrom the ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey, we\ninvestigate whether they may stem from small linear carrier molecules. This\napproach can lead to concrete DIB carrier suggestions, which can be tested in\nlaboratory measurements in future studies. Methods: We suggest that the DIBs we\nstudy here represent individual rotational transitions of a small molecule. We\ndetermined the molecular constants from observation and compared them with data\nfrom a large set of quantum-chemical calculations to confine possible carrier\ncandidates. Furthermore, we determined rotational temperatures by fitting line\nratios using the fitted molecular models. Results: We determined molecular\nconstants for three DIB systems and the corresponding transition types. The\nfitted rotational temperatures lie within the range of known interstellar\ndiatomic molecules. We identified several DIB carrier candidates, almost all of\nthem molecular ions. Some of them are metastable species, indicating the\npossibility of collision complexes as DIB carriers. Conclusions: If our\nhypothesis holds, this would be a major step toward the identification of a\ncarrier molecule of the 6196 A DIB, the strongest among the narrow DIBs.\n","authors":["A.

In one direction we subject the multitude\nof parameters in HL to this variability game, mimicking RG flow in a\ncosmological setting. In the opposite direction, we examine the evolution on\nthe left-over Hamiltonian should the HL algebra of constraints be still\napplicable, rather than the algebra of General Relativity being restored.\nWithin the projectable theory, the non-vanishing Hamiltonian can be\nreinterpreted as a pressureless fluid, resulting in essentially the same\nphenomenologies at macroscopic scales as in the standard cold dark matter\nparadigm. At high energies and short distances, however, unlike in theories\nwith similar variability based on GR, violations of stress-energy tensor\nconservation persist, and these are computed here for the full class of\nprojectable HL models. The phenomenological implications are examined:\nremarkably the driven solution resulting from these energy conservation\nviolations is shown to be the attractor of the system during a free-fall\ncollapse as far as the backreaction is negligible. When the backreaction is\ntaken into account, the driven solution is expected to play an important role\ntowards our understanding of microscopic caustic avoidance, which is one of the\nmost significant issues in many alternatives to particle dark matter scenarios.\n","authors":["Paolo M Bassani","Joao Magueijo","Shinji Mukohyama"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03793v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06313v1","updated":"2025-02-10T10:05:56Z","published":"2025-02-10T10:05:56Z","title":"Gravitational Lensing by a Dark Compact Object in Modified Gravity and\n  Observational Constraints from Einstein Rings","summary":"  In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive study of gravitational lensing\nby dark compact objects predicted by a Modified Gravity (MOG) based on the\nScalar-Vector-Tensor action, and the aim is to analyze new insights into the\nnature of gravitational interactions.

The high\nangular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy\ncomponents: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse,\nextended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and\ngalaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope\n($\\beta_\\text{UV}=-2.2\\pm0.1$). The flux excess, F356W$-$F444W, peaks at the\nE-core ($1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII]\n4960,5008 \\r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is\nbrighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright\nin [OIII] 88 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms\nthat B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the\nstellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, $\\simeq1$ dex\nhigher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E\nis a dusty ($A_\\text{V}=1.2\\pm0.1$ mag) starburst with a possible high dust\ntemperature ($\\ge63$-$68$ K).

Mergers could trigger key evolutionary phases such as starburst\nactivities and active accretion periods onto supermassive black holes at the\ncentres of galaxies. We aim to detect mergers and merger stages (pre- and\npost-mergers) across cosmic history and test whether it is better to detect\nmergers and their merger stages simultaneously or hierarchically. In addition,\nwe want to test the impact of merger time relative to the coalescence of\nmerging galaxies. First, we generated realistic mock JWST images of simulated\ngalaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Then we trained deep learning (DL) models in the Zoobot Python\npackage to classify galaxies into merging/non-merging galaxies and their merger\nstages. We used two different set-ups: (i) two-stage, in which we classify\ngalaxies into mergers and non-mergers and then classify the mergers into\npre-mergers and post-mergers, and (ii) one-stage, in which merger/non-merger\nand merger stages are classified simultaneously. We found that the one-stage\nclassification set-up moderately outperforms the two-stage set-up, offering\nbetter overall accuracy and precision, particularly for the non-merger class.\nPre-mergers can be classified with the highest precision in both set-ups,\npossibly due to the more recognisable merging features and the presence of\nmerging companions. The image signal-to-noise ratio affects the performance of\nthe DL classifiers, but not much after a certain threshold is crossed. Both\nprecision and recall of the classifiers depend strongly on merger time, finding\nit more difficult to identify true mergers observed at stages that are more\ndistant to coalescence.

They are addressed based on the\nstructure and stability of the various isomers of the complexes formed by PAHs\nand their cations with atomic carbon. Carbon complexes with coronene are\nstudied by B3LYP/6-311+ZPVE(B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations, in order to figure out\nthe behaviour of C+ and C complexes with larger pericondensed interstellar\nPAHs, which are thought to be dominant in the ISM. The most stable forms of\n[C-coronene]+ cation include 7C and 4C rings, C+ insertion into a CH bond, and\na 5C ring with a short exocyclic cumulene chain, and similarly for neutral\n[C-coronene]. The subsequent evolution of similar complexes with pericondensed\nPAHs, in diffuse clouds, is discussed under the action of interstellar UV\nphotons and H atoms, as function of the PAH size. Despite the complexity of\nsuch a processing, it seems probable that, for small PAHs, these complexes\nefficiently lose a C2H2 molecule from repeated photodissociations. However,\nthis conclusion needs to be confirmed by the identification of reaction paths\nand the computation of activation energies. The case of the evolution of larger\n[C-PAH] complexes is less clear. Such a processing may explain the observed\nbalance between C+ and PAHs, at least in the diffuse ISM. Such a formation of\nC2H2 from PAH catalysis is a key input for the chemistry of small carbon\nmolecules in diffuse clouds. C+ accretion might frequently form stable PAHs\nthat contain a peripheral pentagonal ring and form a significant fraction of\ninterstellar PAHs.\n","authors":["Alain Omont","Holger F.

We show that $79\\%$ LABs and $83\\%$ bright LABs locate in overdense\nregions, which is consistent with the trend found by previous studies that LABs\ngenerally locate in overdense regions.

The\nintrinsic scatter in Illustris and EAGLE is $\\sim0.3$ dex at $z=0$, and is\ndominated by variations from BH accretion, whereas the smaller scatter of TNG\nis rather dominated by hierarchical merging, suggesting that the massive\ngalaxies in TNG are more tightly quenched. Variations in the BH seed mass can\ncontribute to the scatter of the $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\star}$ relation as well, but\nwhether this still plays a role at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model.\nSimulations with disabled AGN feedback produce much higher scatter for low-mass\ngalaxies than seen in our cosmological simulations, demonstrating the crucial\ninfluence of feedback for determining the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host\ngalaxies in this regime. In contrast, an important factor in reducing the\nscatter for massive galaxies is hierarchical merging of mostly quenched\nsystems.

However\nthey are in opposite directions; in NGC 3201 cooler (and brighter) stars have\nhigher [Fe/H] values, whereas in 47 Tuc they show lower metallicities. The\ntrend is not statistically significant in the former case, but it is in the\nlatter. The dependence of metallicity on the luminosity along the red giant\nbranch seems to indicate problems in the abundance analysis for 47 Tuc.\nFinally, effective temperature do not show a significant variation as a\nfunction of the color spread along the HST pseudo-colour map, which we should\ninstead observe were the trends temperature-metallicity a real effects of\nintrinsic scatter in iron. According to this comparison, we conclude that with\nthese analyses, and the associated spurious trends, the issue of metallicity\nvariations in FG stars is hardly settled.\n","authors":["Eugenio Carretta","Angela Bragaglia"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06941v1.pdf","comment":"7 pages, 7 figures; accepted for publication on Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06942v1","updated":"2025-02-10T19:00:01Z","published":"2025-02-10T19:00:01Z","title":"Shedding light on the star formation rate-halo accretion rate connection\n  and halo quenching mechanism via DECODE, the Discrete statistical\n  sEmi-empiriCal mODEl","summary":"  Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching\ngalaxy star formation are still unclear.

Numerically, several complications render the study of\nnon-ideal MHD effects in 3D simulations extremely challenging and hinder our\nefforts of exploring a large parameter space. We aim to overcome such\nchallenges by proposing a novel, physically-motivated empirical approximation\nto model non-ideal MHD effects. We perform a number of 2D axisymmetric 3-fluid\nnon-ideal MHD simulations of collapsing prestellar cores and clouds with\nnon-equilibrium chemistry and leverage upon previously-published results. We\nutilize these simulations to develop a multivariate interpolating function to\npredict the ionization fraction in each region of the cloud depending on the\nlocal physical conditions. We subsequently use analytically-derived, simplified\nexpressions to calculate the resistivities of the cloud in each grid cell.\nTherefore, in our new approach the resistivities are calculated without the use\nof a chemical network. We benchmark our method against additional 2D\naxisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with random initial conditions and a 3D\nnon-ideal MHD simulation with non-equilibrium chemistry. We find excellent\nquantitative and qualitative agreement between our approach and the \"full\"\nnon-ideal MHD simulations both in terms of the spatial structure of the\nsimulated clouds and regarding their time evolution.

Nominally, the fast\nwind originates from solar sources that are continuously magnetically open to\nthe heliosphere like coronal holes while the slow wind is from solar sources\nthat are only intermittently open to the heliosphere like helmet streamers and\npseudostreamers. The Alfv\\'enic slow wind is an emerging 3rd class of solar\nwind that challenges the two-state fast/slow paradigm.

Although MSPs are thought to originate in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, and\nothers are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding\nhow these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of\nneutron stars (NSs).\n  We studied the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order\nphase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigated\nwhether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as\nneutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, leaves an observable long-lasting\nimprint on the orbit.\n  We simulated mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass\nmain-sequence companion and followed the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and\nspin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we\nassumed a multi-polytrope equation of state that allows for a sharp phase\ntransition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational\nconstraints.\n  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe\noverflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition can occur\nduring the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this\ntransition can take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric\nbinary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick, then the\nbinary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or re-configured into\nan ultra-wide orbit.\n  Our findings suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for\nforming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the\norbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long orbital periods\n(> 50 d) could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense\nnuclear matter.\n","authors":["S.

Two slit- based spectropolarimeters, the\nSunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric\nInfrared spectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the\nnear-infrared regions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable\nMagnetograph (TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of\n$46 \\times 46$ Mm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible.\nThe instruments are operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new\nImage Stabilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating\nWavefront Sensor (CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability\nwith a root-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was\nconstructed to significantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required\nto achieve uninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched\nsuccessfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna\n(Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great\nBear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give\nan overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.\n","authors":["Andreas Korpi-Lagg","Achim Gandorfer","Sami K.

The\nenergetic event was observed at six well-separated locations: Parker Solar\nProbe, Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, STEREO~A, near-Earth S/C, and MAVEN. An\nin-situ shock crossing and a related energetic storm particle (ESP) event were\nobserved at all inner-heliospheric S/C, suggesting that the interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock extended all around the Sun. However,\nthe solar event was accompanied by a series of pre-event CMEs. We aim to\ncharacterize this extreme widespread SEP event and to provide an explanation\nfor the unusual observation of a circumsolar interplanetary shock and\ncorresponding circumsolar ESP event. We analyse data from seven space missions\nto characterize the solar eruption at the Sun, the energetic particle event,\nand the interplanetary context at each observer location as well as the\nmagnetic connectivity of each observer to the Sun. We employ\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar wind in which we inject various\nCMEs that were launched before as well as contemporaneously with the solar\neruption under study. In particular, we test two different scenarios that could\nhave produced the observed global ESP event: 1) a single circumsolar\nblast-wave-like shock launched by the associated solar eruption, and 2) the\ncombination of multiple CMEs driving shocks into different directions. By\ncomparing the simulations of the two scenarios with observations we find that\nboth settings are able to explain the observations. However, the blast-wave\nscenario performs slightly better in terms of the predicted shock arrival times\nat the various observers.\n","authors":["N. Dresing","I. C. Jebaraj","N. Wijsen","E.

This approach offers greater realism compared to\ntraditional coronal models constrained by a static magnetogram. However, its\npractical application is seriously limited by low computational efficiency and\npoor numerical stability. Therefore, we propose an extended magnetic field\ndecomposition strategy and implement it in the implicit MHD model to develop a\ncoronal model that is both efficient and numerically stable enough for\nsimulating the long-term evolutions of the global corona. The traditional\ndecomposition strategies split the magnetic field into a time-invariant\npotential field and a time-dependent component $\\mathbf{B}_1$. It works well\nfor quasi-steady-state coronal simulations where $\\left|\\mathbf{B}_1\\right|$ is\ntypically small. However, as the inner-boundary magnetic field evolves,\n$\\left|\\mathbf{B}_1\\right|$ can grow significantly larger and its\ndiscretization errors often lead to nonphysical negative thermal pressure,\nultimately causing the code to crash. In this paper, we mitigate such undesired\nsituations by introducing a temporally piecewise-constant variable to\naccommodate part of the non-potential field and remain\n$\\left|\\mathbf{B}_1\\right|$ consistently small throughout the simulations. We\nincorporate this novel magnetic field decomposition strategy into our implicit\nMHD coronal model and apply it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures\nwithin 0.1 AU over two solar-maximum Carrington rotations.

New theories about the cores of\nneutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the\nneutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no\nmajor mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically\nprimordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter\nbefore. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime\nof the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to\nThe Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black\nholes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in\ndense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and\nSupermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a\nhierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with\naxion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter.\nThe model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent\nto black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5\n$M_{\\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark\nstars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then\nblack holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after\nall the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of\nmesons.\n","authors":["Zachary R.

The\nX-ray flares exhibit UV and optical counterparts and coincide with the\nbrightest radio flare observed in the past decade, reaching 1.2 mJy at 6 GHz\nand lasting ~1 hour. During the flare, the optical polarization drops from\n~1.4% to ~0.5%, indicating the emergence of an unpolarized component. We\npropose that the thickening of the disc, which enlarges the shock region\nbetween the pulsar wind and the accretion flow and may drive the X-ray flaring\nobserved in tMSPs, enhances the ionization level of the disc, thereby\ngenerating an increased number of free electrons. These electrons could then be\nchannelled by magnetic field lines into the jet. This increased jet\nmass-loading could drive the associated radio and optical variability. The\nradio spectral evolution during flares is consistent with synchrotron\nself-absorption in jet ejecta or internal shocks within the compact jet.

Two slit-based spectropolarimeters, the Sunrise\nUV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric Infrared\nspectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the near-infrared\nregions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable Magnetograph\n(TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of $46 \\times 46$\nMm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible. The instruments\nare operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new Image Stabilization\nand Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating Wavefront Sensor\n(CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability with a\nroot-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was constructed to\nsignificantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required to achieve\nuninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched\nsuccessfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna\n(Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great\nBear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give\nan overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.\n","authors":["Andreas Korpi-Lagg","Achim Gandorfer","Sami K.

The dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\\tau$)\ndistributions provide key insights into FRBs' properties, including source\npopulation, redshift, and energy distribution.

The abundances of some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare\nearth elements) in individual Ryugu particles were found to show large relative\ndispersions compared to the other elements, presumably due to the nugget effect\nof aqueously formed minor secondary minerals (e.g., dolomite, apatite,\nmagnetite, and pyrrhotite). Consequently, the mean abundances of Ryugu for\nthese elements, calculated using currently available Ryugu data, are\naccompanied by a certain degree of uncertainties.

We aim to investigate differences between different parts of the DR9\nfootprint. Furthermore, we want to measure the BAO scale for luminous red\ngalaxies within them. Our selected redshift range of 0.6 to 0.8 corresponds to\nthe bin in which a tension between DESI Y1 and eBOSS was found.\n  Methods. We calculated the anisotropic two-point correlation function in a\nmodified binning scheme to detect the BAOs in DR9 data. We then used template\nfits based on simulations to measure the BAO scale in the imaging data.\n  Results. Our analysis reveals the expected correlation function shape in most\nof the footprint areas, showing a BAO scale consistent with Planck's\nobservations. Aside from identified mask-related data issues in the southern\nregion of the South Galactic Cap, we find a notable variance between the\ndifferent footprints.\n  Conclusions. We find that this variance is consistent with the difference\nbetween the DESI Y1 and eBOSS data, and it supports the argument that that\ntension is caused by sample variance. Additionally, we also uncovered\nsystematic biases not previously accounted for in photometric BAO studies.

The\nstochasticity among different patches is technically rendered via the diverse\nrealizations of a multiplicative noise term (`a little ado') in the\ncosmological equations, and the overall background evolution of the Universe is\nthen operationally defined as an average over the patch ensemble.

A methodology that directly relates the soft X-ray flux\n$F_{SXR}$ of the driving solar flare of a Solar Energetic Particle event to its\n``worst-case\" integral fluence spectrum has recently been proposed by\nPapaioannou et al.

We first show that our method allows us to estimate the integral\nfluence spectra of one of the paleo events, i.e., AD774/775, one of the\nstrongest ESPEs found within the cosmogenic radionuclide records so far.

This review explores observational\nand theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger\nastrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER\nand spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron\nresonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS\nmodifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS\nmergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger\noscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions.

A first-order phase\ntransition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark\ncore, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational\nand theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger\nastrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER\nand spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron\nresonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS\nmodifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS\nmergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger\noscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing\noffers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and\nglitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing\nchallenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical\nsimulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals,\ntwin-star configurations, and NS cooling.

Quantifying these signals constitutes a\nnon-trivial task, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Because of\nthe randomness of the noise phase, the measurements can be either a\nconstructive or a destructive superposition of signal and noise. To recover the\nelectromagnetic energy of the cascade from the radio measurements, the energy\nfluence, i.e. the time integral of the Poynting vector, has to be estimated.\nConventionally, noise subtraction in the time domain has been employed for\nenergy fluence reconstruction, yielding significant biases, including even\nnon-physical and negative values. To mitigate the effect of this bias, usually\nan SNR threshold cut is imposed, at the expense of excluding valuable data from\nthe analyses. Additionally, the uncertainties derived from the conventional\nmethod are underestimated, even for large SNR values. This work tackles these\nchallenges by detailing a method to correctly estimate the uncertainties and\nlower the reconstruction bias in quantifying radio signals, thereby, ideally,\neliminating the need for an SNR cut.

The Hubble parameter\n$H(z)$ at any redshift is reconstructed from the observed Hubble parameter data\nwith the ANN to derive the ADD.

Aims: To investigate the\ndisk-jet scenario in 3C 273 using broadband (0.3--78 keV) X-ray spectra from\n{\\it XMM-Newton} and {\\it NuSTAR}. Methods: We used simultaneous {\\it\nXMM-Newton} and {\\it NuSTAR} observations of 3C 273 carried out between 2012\nand 2024. The 0.3--78 keV X-ray spectra were first fit with a simple power-law\n(PL) and then with the accretion-ejection-based JeTCAF model. The JeTCAF model\naccounts for emission from the jet, extending up to the sonic surface. In this\nframework, a reflection hump above 10 keV can also arise due to the bulk motion\nComptonization of coronal photons by the jet. Results: We found that the simple\nPL did not provide a good fit, leaving significant residuals at energies below\n1.5 keV. All the spectra were fitted well by the JeTCAF model.

It is known that the ISM is turbulent\nwith an observed magnetic field of about a few $\\mu$G, made by the\nsuperposition of a uniform and a fluctuating component.

In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring\nevidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental\ndark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting\nsignatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm\neffect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the\ndark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1\ngravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally\ncouple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a\ngravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational\npotential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional\ndegrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal\nthat, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave\nfunction of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy\nlevels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees\nof freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and\nKaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system\nand eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified\ngravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future.

However, several challenges underscore the urgent need\nto explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum\nmechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark\nenergy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole\nsingularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized\nperspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the\nprinciples of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three\nbroad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance\n(LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or\nparity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence\nprinciple (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of\nGR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for\nunderstanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the\ncurrent and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including\nthose probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and\nEEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address\ncritical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics.

At the same time, both large\nnon-astrophysical backgrounds at TeV energies and scarcity of neutrino events\nin the sub-PeV band currently limit these analyses. Here we use the sample of\ncascade events with estimated neutrino energies above 200 TeV, detected by the\npartially deployed Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD) in six years of\noperation, to test the continuation of the Galactic neutrino spectrum to\nsub-PeV energies. We find that the distribution of the arrival directions of\nBaikal-GVD cascades above 200 TeV in the sky suggests an excess of neutrinos\nfrom low Galactic latitudes with the chance probability of 1.4e-2. We find the\nexcess above 200 TeV also in the most recent IceCube public data sets, both of\ncascades and tracks. The chance probability of the excess in the combined\nIceCube and Baikal-GVD analysis is 3.4e-4.

Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information\nexchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for\nghostzones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations.\nFurthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that require information\nexchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on non-cuboid\nmeshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element\nand its six nearest neighbors. Through this reduction in communication, we aim\nto retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. The goal\nis to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the\nmore robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star\nsurfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element\nshould be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and\ntest the new scheme.

To explore this, we use the 5-year photometrically\nidentified SNe Ia sample obtained by the Dark Energy Survey, along with host\ngalaxy spectra obtained by the Australian Dark Energy Survey. Using host galaxy\nspectroscopy, we find a significant trend with the equivalent width (EW) of the\n[OII] $\\lambda\\lambda$ 3727, 29 doublet, a proxy for specific star formation\nrate, and Hubble residuals. We find that the correlation with [OII] EW is a\npowerful alternative to the commonly used mass step after initial light curve\ncorrections. Applying this [OII] EW correction to 20 SNe Ia in calibrator\ngalaxies observed with WiFeS, we examined the impact on SN Ia absolute\nmagnitudes and $H_{0}$. Our [OII] EW corrections result in $H_{0}$ values\nranging between 73.04 to 73.51 $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,\nwith a combined statistical and systematic uncertainty of $\\sim$1.31\n$\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. However, even with this\nadditional correction, the impact of host galaxy properties in standardising\nSNe Ia appears limited in reducing the current tension ($\\sim$5$\\sigma$) with\nthe CMB result for $H_{0}$.\n","authors":["M.

However, several challenges underscore the urgent need\nto explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum\nmechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark\nenergy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole\nsingularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized\nperspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the\nprinciples of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three\nbroad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance\n(LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or\nparity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence\nprinciple (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of\nGR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for\nunderstanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the\ncurrent and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including\nthose probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and\nEEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address\ncritical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include\ntheir potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe,\nthe nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR\npredictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified\ngravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era\nby focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

It is well-established that compared to the presence of\nfree-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\\ell$-modes in the\npresence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark\nradiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of\nnon-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift.

When asteroids are measured with\nshort observation time windows, the dominant uncertainty in orbit construction\nis due to distance uncertainty to the NEO. One approach to recover distances is\nfrom topocentric parallax, which is a technique that leverages the rotation of\nthe Earth, causing a small but detectable sinusoidal additive signal to the\nRight Ascension (RA) of the NEO following a period of 1 day. In this paper, we\nfurther develop and evaluate this technique to recover distances in as quickly\nas a single night. We first test the technique on synthetic data of 19\ndifferent asteroids ranging from $\\sim0.05 \\,\\text{AU}$ to $\\sim2.4\n\\,\\text{AU}$. We modify previous algorithms and quantify the limitations of the\nmethod, recovering distances with uncertainties as low as the $\\sim1.3\\%$ level\nfor more nearby objects ($\\lesssim$ 0.3 AU) assuming typical astrometric\nuncertainties. We then acquire our own observations of two asteroids within a\nsingle night with $\\sim0.1''$ uncertainties on RA, and we find we are able to\nrecover distances to the $3\\%$ level.

Our analysis indicates that distances to NEOs on the scale\nof $\\sim0.5$ AU can be constrained to below the percent level within a single\nnight, depending on spacing of observations from one observatory.

Hycean worlds are\na recently theorised class of habitable exoplanets with ocean covered surfaces\nand hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Hycean planets are thought to be conducive for\nhosting microbial life under conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans.\nIn the present work we investigate the potential for biological evolution on\nHycean worlds and their dependence on the thermodynamic conditions. We find\nthat a large range of evolutionary rates and origination times are possible for\nunicellular life in oceanic environments for a relatively marginal range in\nenvironmental conditions. For example, a relatively small (10 K) increase in\nthe average ocean temperature can lead to over twice the evolutionary rates,\nwith key unicellular groups originating as early as $\\sim$1.3 billion years\nfrom origin of life. On the contrary, similar decreases in temperatures can\nalso significantly delay the origination times by several billion years. This\ndelay in turn could affect their observable biomarkers such as dimethylsulfide,\nwhich is known to be produced predominantly by Eukaryotic marine phytoplankton\nin Earth's oceans. Therefore, Hycean worlds that are significantly cooler than\nEarth may be expected to host simpler microbial life than Earth's oceans and\nmay show weaker biosignatures, unless they orbit significantly older stars than\nthe Sun. Conversely, Hycean worlds with warmer surface temperatures than Earth\nare more likely to show stronger atmospheric biosignatures due to microbial\nlife if present.\n","authors":["Emily G.

Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a\ncompelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The\nsource of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric\ncalibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general\nagreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance\nindicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024).\nHigh-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will\nenable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in\nfour of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the\ndiscrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or\nsomething intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A\nresolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to\ndetermine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.\n","authors":["Gagandeep S.

A comparison was performed of the helix\nparameters as outlined by fine-scale outflow features with those obtained from\nsynthetic white-light images derived from the high-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulation of interchange reconnection in a pseudostreamer\ntopology by Wyper et al. (2022). A remarkable similarity between the\nsimulation-derived images and the observations was found.

Observed eclipses at unusually high\nfrequencies for J1908$+$2105 significantly aided in constraining the magnetic\nfield and electron column density in the eclipse medium while modeling the\nsynchrotron optical depth. Combining our findings with data from other MSPs in\nthe literature, for the first time we note that a higher cutoff frequency of\neclipsing, particularly above 1 GHz, is consistently associated with a higher\nelectron column density ($>$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the eclipse medium.\nAdditionally, we present the first evidence of lensing effects near eclipse\nboundaries in this MSP, leading to significant magnification of radio\nemissions. The orbital phase resolved polarization analysis presented in this\npaper further indicates variation in rotation measure and consequently stronger\nmagnetic fields in the eclipse region.\n","authors":["Ankita Ghosh","Bhaswati Bhattacharyya","Sangita Kumari","Simon Johnston","Patrick Weltevrede","Jayanta Roy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08357v1.pdf","comment":"Submitted in ApJ"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08288v1","updated":"2025-02-12T10:45:24Z","published":"2025-02-12T10:45:24Z","title":"Impact of accretor size on the morphology of supersonic\n  Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flows","summary":"  Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with\nsurrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow\nshocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes\naffect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its\naccretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to\ndistinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance,\nand the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations\nusing a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the\naccretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the\nstand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these\nspatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady\nstate. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock\nforms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within.\nAccretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while\nlarger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales.\nFully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly\nanisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger\naccretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow\ndirection, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size\nstrongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the\nHoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow\ncharacteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the\nbow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does\nnot affect large-scale flow morphology.\n","authors":["Shaghayegh Ashtari Jolehkaran","Lothar Brendel","Rolf Kuiper"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08288v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07447v2","updated":"2025-02-12T10:15:56Z","published":"2025-02-11T10:48:37Z","title":"Gaia 19cwm - an eclipsing dwarf nova of WZ Sge type with a magnetic\n  white dwarf","summary":"  The spectral and photometric studies of the cataclysmic variable Gaia 19cwm\n(or ZTF19aamkwxk) have been performed.

Their power depends\non the BH magnetic field strength and spin. To survive the infalling stellar\nmaterial, jets need the central BH to attain dynamically important magnetic\nfields that can suppress the mass inflow and lead to a magnetically arrested\ndisk (MAD). Previous work found that non-radiative MADs can spin down their BHs\nto an equilibrium spin, $a_{\\rm eq}^\\text{nr}=0.035-0.07$. Such low spins\nresult in extremely low power jets that may struggle to escape out of the star.\nHowever, the dense and hot collapsar disks emit neutrinos that cool the disk,\nreduce its thickness, and increase the angular momentum supply to the BH. Using\n3D two-moment neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show for the first time that successful collapsar jets powered\nby neutrino-cooled disks still rapidly spin down their BHs, although to a\nhigher $a_{\\rm eq}\\approx 0.13$. This value is consistent with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA\ninferred spins, is $2-4$x higher than for non-radiative MADs, and results in\n$4-16$x more powerful LGRB jets, which are more capable of drilling out of the\nprogenitor star.

In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM\nappears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the absence\nof line emission from the predicted cooling rate suggests heating mechanisms\nthat offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being\nthe most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating\n(``sloshing'') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also\nbeen proposed as mechanisms for the distribution of heat from the outside of\nthe core. Here we present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of\nthe core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that\nthe hot gas is streaming along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy\n(NGC 4696), with relative velocities varying from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~\n30 kpc of the centre, indicating a structured bulk flow (\"wind\") blowing in the\ncore. This wind is consistent with the core gas sloshing. While the wind may\nprevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre of the cluster, it\ncould also distribute the heat injected by the central AGN and/or bring in\nthermal energy from the surrounding ICM, thus contributing to the thermal\nbalance at the cluster centre. The velocity dispersion (turbulent velocity) of\nthe gas is found to be only ~< 120 km/s (corresponding to a Mach number M ~<\n0.2) in the core, even within ~ 10 kpc of the AGN. This may indicate that the\ninfluence of the AGN on the motion of the surrounding ICM is limited in the\nCentaurus cluster.\n","authors":[" XRISM collaboration"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08722v1.pdf","comment":"Original version submitted to Nature in September 2024; see final\n  accepted version at DOI: 10.1038/s41586-024-08561-z"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08718v1","updated":"2025-02-12T19:00:06Z","published":"2025-02-12T19:00:06Z","title":"Flip-flop QPO changes during state transitions: a case study of GX339-4\n  and theoretical discussion","summary":"  We analyse the 2021 outburst from the black hole X-ray binary GX339-4\nobserved by NICER around the hard to soft transition, when the system exhibits\nflip-flops between two distinct luminosity states: a bright state with a 5-6 Hz\nquasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) and a dim state showing only strong broadband\nnoise.

A significant number of PBHs are\nproduced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced\non small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such\nprimordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the\nscalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The\nrecent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the\npulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing\nthe very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are\nassumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the\nmechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to\nexplain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In\nthis work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power\nspectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary\nGWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of\nradiation domination.

This can occur if the\naxion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the\ndiscrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation\nthere is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is\nshown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins\nrotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential\nbarrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later\nepochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the\nprimordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply\nblue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction,\nwhile being testable by next generation CMB experiments.

CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions\noriginate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between\nthe Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or\nformation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of\nthe observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in\nthe Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived\nfrom the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$)\nand expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and\nCH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational\nemission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via\nC$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation\npathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions.\nHowever, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum.\nFinally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping\nmodel provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.\n","authors":["Marion Zannese","Benoît Tabone","Emilie Habart","Emmanuel Dartois","Javier R.

Their interaction with\nsurrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow\nshocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes\naffect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its\naccretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to\ndistinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance,\nand the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations\nusing a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the\naccretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the\nstand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these\nspatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady\nstate. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock\nforms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within.\nAccretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while\nlarger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales.\nFully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly\nanisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind.

A proposed solution to both\nof these puzzles is high-eccentricity migration, in which an initially cold\nJupiter is excited to high eccentricities before being tidally circularized.\nSecular perturbations from an inclined stellar companion are a potential source\nof eccentricity oscillations, a phenomenon known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov\n(EKL) mechanism. Previous studies have found that the cold Jupiter eccentricity\ndistribution produced by EKL is inconsistent with observations. However, these\nstudies assumed all planets start on circular orbits. Here, we revisit this\nquestion, considering that an initial period of planet-planet scattering on\n$\\sim$Myr timescales likely places planets on slightly eccentric orbits before\nbeing modulated by EKL on $\\sim$Myr-Gyr timescales. Small initial\neccentricities can have a dramatic effect by enabling EKL to act at lower\ninclinations. We numerically integrate the secular hierarchical three-body\nequations of motion, including general relativity and tides, for populations of\ncold giant planets in stellar binaries with varied initial eccentricity\ndistributions. For populations with modest initial mean eccentricities, the\nsimulated eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is statistically consistent\nwith the observed eccentricities of cold single-planet systems. The lower\neccentricities in a multi-planet control sample suggest planetary companions\nquench stellar EKL. We show that scattering alone is unlikely to reproduce the\npresent-day eccentricity distribution.

Our goal is to use the first\ndetection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in\nthe protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe\ntheir formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical\nconditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS\ninstruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small\nscales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions\noriginate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between\nthe Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or\nformation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of\nthe observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in\nthe Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived\nfrom the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$)\nand expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and\nCH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational\nemission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via\nC$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation\npathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions.\nHowever, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum.\nFinally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping\nmodel provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.\n","authors":["Marion Zannese","Benoît Tabone","Emilie Habart","Emmanuel Dartois","Javier R.

Their interaction with\nsurrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow\nshocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes\naffect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its\naccretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to\ndistinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance,\nand the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations\nusing a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the\naccretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the\nstand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these\nspatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady\nstate. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock\nforms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within.\nAccretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while\nlarger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales.\nFully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly\nanisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger\naccretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow\ndirection, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size\nstrongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the\nHoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow\ncharacteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the\nbow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does\nnot affect large-scale flow morphology.\n","authors":["Shaghayegh Ashtari Jolehkaran","Lothar Brendel","Rolf Kuiper"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08288v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01255v3","updated":"2025-02-12T10:22:52Z","published":"2024-09-02T13:46:24Z","title":"PAMS: The Perseus Arm Molecular Survey -- I.

We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted\nabundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \\leq\nM_{500}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot} \\leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates\nlower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better\nagreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich\nthe IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely\nrelated to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D\nmass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM\nabundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by\nreduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling\nof metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass\nin low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and\nstellar feedback models.

In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM\nappears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the absence\nof line emission from the predicted cooling rate suggests heating mechanisms\nthat offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being\nthe most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating\n(``sloshing'') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also\nbeen proposed as mechanisms for the distribution of heat from the outside of\nthe core. Here we present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of\nthe core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that\nthe hot gas is streaming along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy\n(NGC 4696), with relative velocities varying from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~\n30 kpc of the centre, indicating a structured bulk flow (\"wind\") blowing in the\ncore. This wind is consistent with the core gas sloshing. While the wind may\nprevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre of the cluster, it\ncould also distribute the heat injected by the central AGN and/or bring in\nthermal energy from the surrounding ICM, thus contributing to the thermal\nbalance at the cluster centre. The velocity dispersion (turbulent velocity) of\nthe gas is found to be only ~< 120 km/s (corresponding to a Mach number M ~<\n0.2) in the core, even within ~ 10 kpc of the AGN.

Our goal is to use the first\ndetection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in\nthe protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe\ntheir formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical\nconditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS\ninstruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small\nscales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions\noriginate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between\nthe Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or\nformation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of\nthe observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in\nthe Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506.

These results show that CH$^+$ and\nCH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational\nemission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via\nC$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H.

When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner\nzones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets\nremove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional\nnumerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass\nand energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading\nto rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we\nstop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial\nradius.

They also serve\nas useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass\nratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral\ncan be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic\norbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence\nis determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of\nmotion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any\nmoment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a\n``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion.\nThis restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the\nbackreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body\napproaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and\nthe backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO,\nits trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly\nconnect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and\nthe final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for\ncircular systems.

The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion\ndisks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation,\neffectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from\ndisk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state\nsolutions in the outer disks.

We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs\nquickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume\nless gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances\nthe mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the\nlifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring\nin the inner disk.

To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute\nthe Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the\nppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the\nsignal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE\nparameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are\ncharacterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE\nmodel. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for\nthe ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing\nasymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does\nnot impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis,\ntherefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which\nparametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear\nsignal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them\nby obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the\neffective cycles incurred due to mismodeling.

However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters\nthat may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited\nsensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their\nphysical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method\nbased on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and\napply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral\nmorphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key\nfeatures for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results\nsuggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas\nnon-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission.

Although existing RFI flagging tools have achieved some success,\nthe pervasive nature of this contamination leads to the rejection of excessive\ndata volumes. In this work, we present a way to estimate an RFI emitter's\naltitude using near-field corrections. Being able to obtain the precise\nlocation of such an emitter could shift the strategy from merely flagging to\nsubtracting or peeling the RFI, allowing us to preserve a higher fraction of\nusable data.

These latent parameters have a physical\ninterpretation in terms of well-known features of the CMB temperature spectrum:\nthese include the position, height and even-odd modulation of the acoustic\npeaks, as well as the gravitational lensing effect. The VAE also discovers one\nlatent parameter which entirely isolates the EDE effects from those related to\n$\\Lambda$CDM parameters, thus revealing a previously unknown degree of freedom\nin the CMB temperature power spectrum.

Recently, a new\nmethod was developed which allows for the estimation and correction of errors\nintroduced by this approximation, which we refer to as the unequal time\ncorrelator-level projection. For single tracer power spectra, corrections arise\nat second order and above in a series expansion, with first order terms\nsurviving only in multi-tracer analyses. In this paper we develop a new method\nwhich we refer to as the unequal time field level projection. This formalism\nprojects the fields individually onto the celestial sphere, displaced from\nindividual reference times, before defining their correlators. This method\nintroduces new, first order correction terms even in the case of single tracer\npower spectra. Specifically, new first order terms are introduced which apply\nto both cross-bin and single bin correlators. All of these new corrections\noriginate with derivatives over combinations of a delta function, a cross-bin\nphase term, and the power spectrum itself and stem from the introduction of two\nunequal time Fourier transforms into the analysis. We analyse these corrections\nin the context of a linearly biased power spectrum divided between two redshift\nbins and find that they can lead to non-trivial corrections, particularly to\ncross-bin correlators.

By applying our\nPhotometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) method to the BOSS survey and the\nDESI deep photometric survey, we obtained hundreds of cross-correlation\nmeasurements to establish an accurate galaxy-halo connection for BOSS galaxies\nthrough the halo abundance matching technique (Paper IV).

In this study, we measure the XUV luminosity for TOI-431 with\nXMM-Newton/EPIC-pn and OM data, then calculate the fluxes for the planets in\nthe system.

These processes\ncan trigger pile-ups of solids, making the water snowline a promising site for\nforming planetesimals. However, previous studies exploring the pile-up\nconditions typically employ 1D, vertically-averaged and isothermal assumptions.\nIn this work, we investigate how a 2D flow pattern and realistic temperature\nstructure affect the pile-up of pebbles at the snowline and how latent heat\neffects can leave observational imprints. We perform 2D (R-Z) multifluid\nhydrodynamic simulations, tracking chemically heterogeneous pebbles and the\nreleased vapor. With a recent-developed phase change module, the mass transfer\nand latent heat exchange during ice sublimation are calculated\nself-consistently. The temperature is calculated by a two-stream radiation\ntransfer method under various opacities and stellar luminosity. We find that\nvapor injection at the snowline drives a previously unrecognized outflow,\nleading to a pile-up of ice outside the snowline. Vapor injection also\ndecreases the headwind velocity in the pile-up, promoting planetesimal\nformation and pebble accretion. In active disks, we identify a water-cycle:\nafter ice sublimates in the hotter midplane, vapor recondenses onto pebbles in\nthe upper, cooler layers, which settle back to the midplane. This cycle\npromotes ice-trapping at snowline. Latent heat exchange flattens the\ntemperature gradient across the snowline, broadening the width while reducing\nthe peak solid-to-gas ratio of pile-ups. Due to the water cycle, active disks\nare more conducive to planetesimal formation than passive disks. The\nsignificant temperature dip (~ 40K) caused by latent heat cooling manifests as\nan intensity dip in the dust continuum, presenting a new channel to identify\nthe water snowline in outbursting systems.\n","authors":["Yu Wang","Chris W.

Its efficiency in\nclumping particles depends primarily on the dimensionless stopping time\n($\\tau_s$, a proxy for particle size) and dust-to-gas surface density ratio\n($Z$). Previous simulations identified a critical $Z$ ($Z_{\\rm{crit}}$) above\nwhich strong clumping occurs, where particle densities exceed the Hill density\n(thus satisfying a condition for gravitational collapse), over a wide range of\n$\\tau_s$. These works found that for $\\tau_s \\leq 0.01$, $Z_{\\rm{crit}}$ was\nabove the ISM value $(\\sim 0.01)$. In this work, we reexamine the clumping\nthreshold using 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations at high resolution and\nwith relatively large (compared to many previous simulations) domain sizes. Our\nmain results are as follows: First, when $\\tau_s = 0.01$, strong clumping\noccurs even at $Z \\lesssim 0.01$, lower than $Z_{\\rm{crit}}$ found in all\nprevious studies. Consequently, we revise a previously published fit to the\n$Z_{\\rm{crit}}$ curve to account for this updated $Z_{\\rm{crit}}$. Second,\nhigher resolution results in a thicker dust layer, which may result from other\ninstabilities manifesting, such as the vertical shearing streaming instability.\nThird, despite this thicker layer, higher resolution can lead to strong\nclumping even with lower midplane dust-to-gas density ratios (which results\nfrom the thicker particle layer) so long as $Z \\gtrsim Z_{\\rm{crit}}$. Our\nresults demonstrate the efficiency of the SI in clumping small particles at $Z\n\\sim 0.01$, which is a significant refinement of the conditions for\nplanetesimal formation by the SI.\n","authors":["Jeonghoon Lim","Jacob B.

In this work we determine the\ndistance at which an Earth-sized planet orbiting a variety of stellar hosts\ncould retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere and compare this atmospheric\nretention distance (ARD) with that of the liquid-water HZ. We combined\nplanetary atmosphere models with stellar evolution models. The atmospheric\nmodels produced by the thermochemical Kompot code allowed us to calculate the\nJeans escape rates for different stellar masses, rotation rates, and ages.\nThese loss rates allowed us to determine the closest distance a planet is\nlikely to retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere. Using stellar rotation\nevolution models, we modelled how these retention distances evolve as the X-ray\nand ultraviolet activity of the star evolves. We find that the overlap of the\nHZ and the ARD occurs earlier around slowly rotating stars. Additionally, we\nfind that HZ planets orbiting stars with masses under 0.4 M_\\odot are unlikely\nto retain any atmosphere, due to the lower spin-down rate of these fully\nconvective stars. We also show that the initial rotation rate of the star can\nimpact the likelihood of a planet retaining an atmosphere, as an initially\nfast-rotating star maintains high levels of short-wavelength irradiance for\nmuch longer. The orbits of all Earth-like rocky exoplanets observed by JWST in\ncycles 1 and 2, including HZ planets, fall outside the ARD.

An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in\ndense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase\nunknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a\nsubstantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its\nwavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the\nS-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to\ndetermine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We\ncarried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and\nS8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at\n6.8 {\\mu}m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 {\\mu}m for the first\ntime. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature,\nallow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with\nJWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice\nspecies determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs\nand MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the\ninstruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for\nthree stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of\nS-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection\nof H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable\nphysical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected.\nAlthough the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur\nbudget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound\n(H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.\n","authors":["A.

Here, we\nperform $N$-body simulations of star clusters, focusing on BBH formation\nmechanisms, dynamical evolution and merging properties. We explore a wide\nparameter space of initial conditions, with cluster masses ranging from\n$10^{4}$ to $10^{6}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, densities from $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}~\\rm\nM_{\\odot}pc^{-3}$, and up to $100\\%$ of massive stars in binaries. We show that\nmost BBH mergers originate from the primordial binary population rather than\nbeing dynamically assembled, and that the evolution towards merger for most of\nthese binaries is not significantly altered by dynamical encounters. As a\nresult, the overall number of BBH mergers from the $N$-body simulations is\nnearly identical to that obtained when the same stellar population is evolved\nin isolation. Contrary to theoretical expectations, nearly all dynamically\nformed BBH mergers occur when the binary is still bound to its host cluster,\nwith $\\simeq 90\\%$ of all dynamical mergers occurring within the cluster core\nregion. In about half of these mergers the binary is part of a stable black\nhole-triple system. In one model, stellar mergers lead to the formation of a\n$\\simeq 200\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ black hole, which then grows to $\\simeq\n300\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ through black hole mergers.

The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion\ndisks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation,\neffectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from\ndisk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state\nsolutions in the outer disks. Here, we examine the consequences of this star\nformation with a semi-analytical model in which stellar-mass black hole (sBH)\nremnants in the disk provide an additional source of stabilizing radiative\nfeedback. Assuming star formation seeds the embedded sBH population, we model\nthe time-evolving feedback from both stars and the growing population of\naccreting sBHs. We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs\nquickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume\nless gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances\nthe mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the\nlifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring\nin the inner disk. Heating from the embedded sBHs significantly modifies the\ndisk's temperature profile and hardens its spectral energy distribution, and\ndirect emission from the sBHs adds a new hard X-ray component.\n","authors":["Marguerite Epstein-Martin","Hiromichi Tagawa","Zoltan Haiman","Rosalba Perna"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09380v2.pdf","comment":"25 pages, 18 figures, 1 table.

During these phases, giant stellar eruptions lead\nto exceptionally high mass-loss rates, forming significant amounts of dust.\nHowever, the survival of these dust grains is challenged by the powerful shock\nwaves generated when the progenitor explodes as a supernova (SN). We explore\nthe impact of hydrogen-rich SN explosions from 45, 50, and 60 M$_\\odot$\nprogenitors on dust formed after these eruptions, focusing on interactions with\ncircumstellar shells occurring from a few years to centuries after the event.\nUsing 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we track the evolution of dust particles\nin a scenario that includes the progenitor's stellar wind, a giant eruption,\nand the subsequent SN explosion, following the mass budgets predicted by\nstellar evolution models. For a standard SN ejecta mass of 10 M$_\\odot$ and\nkinetic energy of $10^{51}$ erg, only 25% of the dust mass survives 250 years\npost-explosion in a spherical circumstellar medium (CSM), while merely 2%\nremains a century after the explosion in a bipolar CSM. If the SN follows the\neruption within a dozen years, 75% of the dust survives for a standard\nexplosion, dropping to 20% for more massive ejecta (15-20 M$_\\odot$) with\nkinetic energy of $5 \\times 10^{51}$ erg. The geometry of the CSM and the early\ntransition of the SN remnant into a radiative phase significantly influence\ndust survival. As the shock wave weakens and efficiently converts kinetic\nenergy into thermal radiation (up to half of the injected kinetic energy) the\nlikelihood of dust survival increases, affecting not only pre-existing dust in\nthe CSM but also SN-condensed dust and ambient interstellar dust. Contrary to\nexpectations, a larger fraction of the dust mass can survive if the SN occurs\nonly a few years after the eruption.\n","authors":["Diana B.

A flaring activity was\nalso observed during the source highest flux epochs. Flares are unpredictable,\nwith different durations and all flat-topped in flux. The latter suggests that,\nat the flare peaks, there is likely a common switch-off mechanism for the\naccretion onto the compact object. We analysed all the available XMM-Newton and\nSwift/XRT observations to investigate the spectral and temporal evolution of\nX7, looking for short and long-term variability. We look for long-term\nperiodicities and for coherent signals through accelerated searches that\nincluded orbital corrections. We described the X7 spectra with two thermal\ncomponents plus a cut-off powerlaw model. We found three well defined spectral\nstates, where the spectral variability is mainly driven by the two harder\ncomponents. In addition, a pulsed signal at 2.6-2.7s was detected in two\nXMM-Newton observations. The significance of these coherent signals is\nrelatively weak but they are found in two different observations with the same\nparameter space for the orbital properties. If confirmed, it would imply a high\nspin-down of 1e-9 s/s, which could be extreme amongst the known pulsating ULXs.\nX7 would become a new extragalactic ULX pulsar.

Our fiducial simulations adopt a faster-moving, less\nmassive dynamical ejecta and slower-moving, more massive post-merger ejecta.\nThe results of analytic modeling, however, show that the inferred ''red''\ncomponent is more massive and slower, while the ''blue'' component is less\nmassive and faster, as also inferred for GW170817/AT2017gfo. This suggests that\nthe parameters derived from light curve modeling with an analytic model do not\nrepresent the true configuration of the kilonova ejecta. We demonstrate that\nthe post-merger ejecta contributes to both blue and red emissions: the emission\nfrom the post-merger ejecta is absorbed and reprocessed to red emission by the\ndynamical ejecta with a higher lanthanide fraction. Our results caution against\nseparately discussing the origins of red and blue components derived from the\nanalytic models.

Early monitoring of the SN also\nshowed the presence of a dense CSM structure near the star ($10^{15}$ cm) that\nwas probably expelled in the last years prior to the explosion.

The SN evolution is\nanalyzed in comparison with a previous spectrum at an age of 259 days, and\ncompared with those of similar SNe II and with synthetic radiation-transfer\nnebular spectra. The 445-d spectrum exhibits a dramatic evolution with clear\nsigns of ejecta-CSM interaction.

Traditional methods\nsegment images into patches, convolve patches with individual PSFs, and\nreassemble them as a whole image. Although widely used, these approaches suffer\nfrom slow convolution processes and reduced image fidelity due to abrupt PSF\ntransitions between different patches.

Low-level rf (LLRF) systems are\nemployed to set the phase and amplitude of the field in the accelerating\nstructure, and to compensate the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the rf field in\nthe accelerating structures with a feedback loop. The LLRF systems are\ntypically implemented with analogue rf mixers, heterodyne based architectures\nand discrete data converters. There are multiple rf signals from each of rf\nstation, so the number of rf channels required increases rapidly with multiple\nrf stations. With many rf channels, the footprint, component cost and system\ncomplexity of the LLRF hardware increase significantly. To meet the design\ngoals to be compact and affordable for future accelerators, we have designed\nthe next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) with higher integration level based on RFSoC\ntechnology. The NG-LLRF system samples rf signals directly and performs the rf\nmixing digitally. The NG-LLRF has been characterized in a loopback mode to\nevaluate the performance of the system and tested with a standing-wave\naccelerating structure, a prototype for the Cool Copper Collider (C3) with peak\nrf power up to 16.45 MW. The loopback test demonstrated amplitude fluctuation\nbelow 0.15% and phase fluctuation below 0.15 degree, which are considerably\nbetter than the requirements of C3. The rf signals from the different stages of\naccelerating structure at different power levels are measured by the NG-LLRF,\nwhich will be critical references for the control algorithm designs. The\nNG-LLRF also offers flexibility in waveform modulation, so we have used rf\npulses with various modulation schemes which could be useful for controlling\nsome of rf stations in accelerators.

The origin of the valley is\nnormally attributed to mass-loss process such as photoevaporation or\ncore-powered mass loss.

Next, we use our analytical\nprescription, informed by a three-dimensional dust density map, to estimate the\nexpected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in\nwhich the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and\nsynchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find\nthat, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the\nlatter is very significant at Galactic latitudes $|b|>45^\\circ$. Our results\nunderline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale\nGalactic magnetic field studies.\n","authors":["V. Pelgrims","M. Unger","I. C.

The observed\nextinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron\nhas been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests\nthat CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO\ndepletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest\nthat CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in\nwater-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out\nthus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code\nemployed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of\nastrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations)\nto test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice\nchemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced\nfor gas densities >1e5 cm-3 and collapse times >1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms\npredominantly (>99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH\nand C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O\ndepending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are\nefficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is\nlargely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher\namount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase.\nLarge differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust<12 K between\ndiffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that\nnon-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust.

Currently,\n10 QPE sources are reported in the literature, and a major challenge lies in\nidentifying more because they are (apparently) intrinsically and exclusively\nX-ray bright. Here we highlight the unusual infrared (IR) echo of the tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) -- and subsequent QPE source -- AT2019qiz, which rose\ncontinuously and approximately linearly with time over roughly 1000 days\n(between 2019 and 2024). We argue that this continuous long rise alongside the\nrelatively high inferred IR temperature (800-1200 K) cannot be generated by the\nTDE itself, including the late-time/remnant TDE disk, but that the reprocessing\nof the light from the QPEs by a shell of dust can reproduce the observations.\nThis model predicts 1) IR QPEs at the 0.1 percent level that are potentially\ndetectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, and 2) that if the QPEs cease\nin AT2019qiz, the IR light curve should decline steadily and linearly over the\nsame 1000-day timescale.

Our findings reveal a symmetrical Gaussian\npattern in the Stokes I parameter of the central beam without strong sidelobes,\nwhile the off-center beams exhibit significant asymmetrical shapes that can be\nfitted using a combination of log-normal and Gaussian distributions. The inner\nbeams have higher relative beam efficiencies and smaller beam sizes compared to\nthose of the outer beams. The sidelobes of the inner beams contribute\napproximately 2% of the total flux in the main lobe, increasing to 5% for outer\nbeams, with a peak at 6.8%. In Stokes U, a distinct four-lobed cloverleaf beam\nsquash structure is observed, with similar intensity levels in both inner and\nouter beams. In Stokes V, a two-lobed beam squint structure is observed in the\ncentral beam, along with a secondary eight-lobed structure. The highest squint\npeak in Stokes V is about 0.3% of the Stokes I in the outer beams. These\nresults align closely with the simulations, providing valuable insights for the\ndesign of radio multi-beam observations.\n","authors":["Xunzhou Chen","Tao-Chung Ching","Di Li","Carl Heiles","Timothy Robishaw","Xuan Du","Marko Krco","Peng Jiang","Qingliang Yang","Jiguang Lu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18865v2.pdf","comment":"25 pages, 20 figures.

Of these, LHS 1478 b orbits an M3-type star, has an equilibrium\ntemperature of T$_{eq}$ = 585 K and receives 21 times Earth's instellation.

In recent\nyears, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of\nspectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers.

Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can\nprovide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true\nDoppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed\neffects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line\nshapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our\nmethodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and\ncross-validation to control for overfitting.

We also resolve the planetary velocity traces of both Ti I and\nV I, with Ti I exhibiting a significant blueshift toward the end of the\ntransit.

Accurate modelling of atmospheric processes is essential to\ninterpreting high-precision spectroscopic data given the wide range of possible\nconditions in the sub-Neptune regime, including on potentially habitable\nplanets. Notably, convection is an important process which can operate in\ndifferent modes across sub-Neptune conditions. Convection can act very\ndifferently in atmospheres with a high condensible mass fraction (non-dilute\natmospheres) or with a lighter background gas, e.g. water convection in a\nH$_2$-rich atmosphere, and can be much weaker or even shut down entirely in the\nlatter case. We present a new mass-flux scheme which can capture these\nvariations and simulate convection over a wide range of parameter space for use\nin 3D general circulation models (GCMs). We validate our scheme for two\nrepresentative cases, a terrestrial-like atmosphere and a mini-Neptune\natmosphere. In the terrestrial case, considering TRAPPIST-1e with an Earth-like\natmosphere, the model performs near-identically to Earth-tuned models in an\nEarth-like convection case. In the mini-Neptune case, considering the bulk\nproperties of K2-18b and assuming a deep H$_2$-rich atmosphere, we demonstrate\nthe capability of the scheme to reproduce non-condensing convection.

We\nidentify GMCs in simulated galaxies and track their evolution using cloud\nevolution trees. Via cloud evolution trees, we quantify the lifetimes and SFE\nof GMCs. We further apply our diagnostics on a suite of simulations with\nvarying star formation and stellar feedback subgrid models and explore their\nimpact together with galactic environments to the GMC life cycles. Our analysis\nreveals that GMCs undergo dynamic evolution, characterized by continuous gas\naccretion, gravitational collapse, and star formation, followed by disruption\ndue to stellar feedback. The accretion process sustains the gas content\nthroughout most of the GMC life cycles, resulting in a positive correlation\nbetween GMC lifetimes and their maximum masses. The GMC lifetimes range from a\nfew to several tens of Myr, with two distinct dynamical modes: (1) GMCs near\nthe galactic center experience strong tidal disturbances, prolonging their\nlifetimes when they remain marginally unbound; (2) those in the outer regions\nare less affected by tides, remain gravitationally bound, and evolve more\nrapidly. In all model variations, we observe that GMC-scale SFE correlates with\nthe baryonic surface density of GMCs, consistent with previous studies of\nisolated GMCs. Additionally, we emphasize the critical role of galactic shear\nin regulating GMC-scale star formation and refine the correlation between local\nSFE and surface density by including its effects.

Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova (SN) neutrinos,\nespecially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific\npossibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances\nto SNe using neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship\nbetween the radius of a neutron star (NS) and the distance to the SN, which is\nanalogous to main-sequence fitting. The radius of an NS is determined with an\napproximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and\ngravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the SN\ncan be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level.\nIt has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of SNe, and\nwhen combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes\nachievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using\nmulti-messenger approaches.

Assuming the plasma moves toward the observers with a bulk Lorentz\nfactor of $\\Gamma=100$ and the electron distribution in an individual blob is\nmonoenergetic ($\\gamma_{\\rm e}\\sim300$), our analysis shows that bright and\nnarrow-banded radio bursts with peak flux density $\\sim$ 1 ${\\rm Jy}$ at peak\nfrequency ($\\nu_{\\rm pk}$) $\\sim 3.85$ GHz can be produced by the synchrotron\nmaser emission if the plasma blob has a magnetization factor of\n$\\sigma\\sim10^{-5}$ and a frequency of $\\nu_{\\rm P}\\sim 4.5$ MHz.

Deep reinforcement learning is used to learn a\npolicy that can improve the feasible solution by iteratively local rewriting\nuntil convergence. It can solve the challenge of obtaining a complete solution\ndirectly from scratch in astronomical observation scenarios, due to the high\ncomputational complexity resulting from numerous spatial and temporal\nconstraints. A simulation environment is developed based on real-world\nscenarios for experiments, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed\nscheduling approach. The experimental results show that ROARS surpasses 5\npopular heuristics, adapts to various observation scenarios and learns\neffective strategies with hindsight.\n","authors":["Yajie Zhang","Ce Yu","Chao Sun","Jizeng Wei","Junhan Ju","Shanjiang Tang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11134v1.pdf","comment":null}],"Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10877v2","updated":"2025-02-16T18:33:14Z","published":"2024-07-15T16:25:29Z","title":"Optimal Neural Summarisation for Full-Field Weak Lensing Cosmological\n  Implicit Inference","summary":"  Traditionally, weak lensing cosmological surveys have been analyzed using\nsummary statistics motivated by their analytically tractable likelihoods, or by\ntheir ability to access higher-order information, at the cost of requiring\nSimulation-Based Inference (SBI) approaches. While informative, these\nstatistics are neither designed nor guaranteed to be statistically sufficient.\nWith the rise of deep learning, it becomes possible to create summary\nstatistics optimized to extract the full data information. We compare different\nneural summarization strategies proposed in the weak lensing literature, to\nassess which loss functions lead to theoretically optimal summary statistics to\nperform full-field inference. In doing so, we aim to provide guidelines and\ninsights to the community to help guide future neural-based inference analyses.\nWe design an experimental setup to isolate the impact of the loss function used\nto train neural networks. We have developed the sbi_lens JAX package, which\nimplements an automatically differentiable lognormal wCDM LSST-Y10 weak lensing\nsimulator. The explicit full-field posterior obtained using the Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo sampler gives us a ground truth to which to compare different\ncompression strategies. We provide theoretical insight into the loss functions\nused in the literature and show that some do not necessarily lead to sufficient\nstatistics (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE)), while those motivated by information\ntheory (e.g. Variational Mutual Information Maximization (VMIM)) can. Our\nnumerical experiments confirm these insights and show, in our simulated wCDM\nscenario, that the Figure of Merit (FoM) of an analysis using neural summaries\noptimized under VMIM achieves 100% of the reference Omega_c - sigma_8\nfull-field FoM, while an analysis using neural summaries trained under MSE\nachieves only 81% of the same reference FoM.\n","authors":["Denise Lanzieri","Justine Zeghal","T.

After confirming the presence of chemical species in our atmospheric\nmodel, we combined the pre- and post-eclipse datasets for a joint analysis. By\nemploying a Bayesian retrieval framework, this joint retrieval enabled us to\nconstrain the spatially varying temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and\natmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detected strong emission\nsignatures of CO and H$_2$O in the post-eclipse and combined datasets.

Certain star formation\ntheories involve a close connection between the IMF and the Core Mass Function\n(CMF) so it is important to measure this CMF in a range of Milky Way locations.\nHere we study the CMF of three Galactic Center clouds: G0.253+0.016 (\"The\nBrick\"), Sgr B2 (Deep South field) and Sgr C. We use ALMA 1 mm continuum images\nand identify cores as peaks in thermal dust emission via the dendrogram\nalgorithm. We develop a completeness correction method via synthetic core\ninsertion, utilizing a realistic mass-dependent size distribution. A power law\n$\\text{d}N/\\text{d}\\log M \\propto M^{-\\alpha}$ is fit to the CMFs\n$>2\\:M_\\odot$.

Additionally, it exhibits two giant stellar streams,\nthe largest extending 200 kpc, likely linked to past interactions.\n  Aims. We investigate the orbital dynamics of Malin 1's satellites and their\nrelationship with the observed stellar streams, testing their consistency with\ndifferent formation scenarios.\n  Methods. We constructed gravitational potentials using optical and H I\nrotation curve data, using stellar, gaseous, and dark matter components. We\nexplored a wide parameter space to see if the candidate progenitors of the\nstellar streams could have originated from past interactions, testing both NFW\nand isothermal halo profiles.\n  Results. Among ten explored scenarios, seven produced bound orbital\nsolutions. The isothermal halo model, with a virial mass of 3.8 x 10^12 solar\nmasses and a virial radius of approximately 323 kpc, favors bound satellite\norbits more than the NFW model (1.7 x 10^12 solar masses).

For the small $^{12}$C($\\alpha,\n\\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further\nenhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is\nstrengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the\ncontraction of outer layers and decrease the {\\sl compactness parameter} at\n$M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores\nof Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell\nin the presupernova models.

The rule is considered to\nbe related to the solar dynamo, which drives the evolution of the Sun's\nlarge-scale magnetic field. However, observational studies of the G-O rule have\nrevealed inconsistencies, particularly regarding long-term variations and the\nunderlying physical mechanisms. In this study, we use an iterative map derived\nwithin the framework of the Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo to analyze the G-O\nrule. We investigate comprehensive and definitive forms of the G-O rule using\nboth a sufficiently large number of solar cycles and a limited number of solar\ncycles. Our findings indicate a higher probability for an arbitrary cycle to be\nfollowed by a stronger cycle instead of weaker, regardless of even or odd. Over\ntime spans comparable to historical observations, cycles exhibit periods that\nfollow both the G-O rule and the reversed G-O rule, without a statistically\nsignificant preference, consistent with the observed variability of the G-O\nrule. The occurrence of the reversed G-O rule is random, rather than periodic.\nThe G-O rule emerges as a result of the nonlinearity and stochasticity inherent\nin the BL mechanism. These results advance our understanding of the solar cycle\nand pave the way for improved solar dynamo modeling.\n","authors":["Zi-Fan Wang","Jie Jiang","Jing-Xiu Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11120v1.pdf","comment":"12 pages, 6 figures, to be submitted"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11118v1","updated":"2025-02-16T13:28:53Z","published":"2025-02-16T13:28:53Z","title":"Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. I. Nature of Solar\n  Cycle Variability","summary":"  Inter-cycle variations in the series of 11-year solar activity cycles have a\nsignificant impact on both the space environment and climate. Whether solar\ncycle variability is dominated by deterministic chaos or stochastic\nperturbations remains an open question. Distinguishing between the two\nmechanisms is crucial for predicting solar cycles. Here we reduce the solar\ndynamo process responsible for the solar cycle to a one-dimensional iterative\nmap, incorporating recent advance in the observed nonlinearity and\nstochasticity of the cycle. We demonstrate that deterministic chaos is absent\nin the nonlinear system, regardless of model parameters, if the generation of\nthe poloidal field follows an increase-then-saturate pattern as the cycle\nstrength increases. The synthesized solar cycles generated by the iterative map\nexhibit a probability density function (PDF) similar to that of observed normal\ncycles, supporting the dominant role of stochasticity in solar cycle\nvariability. The parameters governing nonlinearity and stochasticity profoundly\ninfluence the PDF. The iterative map provides a quick and effective tool for\npredicting the range, including uncertainty of the subsequent cycle strength\nwhen an ongoing cycle amplitude is known. Due to stochasticity, a solar cycle\nloses almost all its original information within 1 or 2 cycles. Although the\nsimplicity of the iterative map, the behaviors it exhibits are generic for the\nnonlinear system. Our results provide guidelines for analyzing solar dynamo\nmodels in terms of chaos and stochasticity, highlight the limitation in\npredicting solar cycle, and motivate further refinement of observational\nconstraints on nonlinear and stochastic processes.\n","authors":["Zi-Fan Wang","Jie Jiang","Jing-Xiu Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11118v1.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ and under second revision"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11012v1","updated":"2025-02-16T06:34:39Z","published":"2025-02-16T06:34:39Z","title":"The Impact of $^{12}$C($α, γ$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the\n  Presupernova Evolution and Explodability of Massive Stars","summary":"  Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the\n$^{12}$C($\\alpha, \\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of\nmassive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\\odot$ and\nthe solar metallicity. We show that the {\\sl explodability} of these stars,\ni.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive\nto the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass\nfractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\\alpha,\n\\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further\nenhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is\nstrengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the\ncontraction of outer layers and decrease the {\\sl compactness parameter} at\n$M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores\nof Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell\nin the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the\nmodel is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the\npressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$,\nwhere $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar\nstructure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning\nshell above which the model is more likely to explode.

In order to statistically infer merger redshifts, the\n``spectral standard siren\" method relies on features, such as peaks, dips or\nbreaks, in the compact object mass spectrum, which get redshifted in the\ndetector-frame relative to the source-frame. However, if the source-frame\nlocation of these features evolves over cosmic time, the spectral siren\nmeasurement may be biased. Some features, such as the edges of the\npair-instability supernova mass gap, may be more stable than others. We point\nout that binary black hole (BBH) spins, which are not redshifted in the\ndetector-frame, provide a natural way to identify robust mass scales for\nspectral siren cosmology. For example, there is recent evidence for a mass\nscale in the BBH population that separates slowly spinning from more rapidly\nspinning BBH mergers, consistent with the lower edge of the pair instability\ngap. Applying our method to data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third transient\ncatalog, we demonstrate how to isolate this mass scale and produce a robust\n``spinning spectral siren\" measurement of the Hubble constant: $H_0 =\n85^{+99}_{-67}\\,\\rm{km}\\, \\rm{s}^{-1} \\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, or $H_0\n=80^{+60}_{-46}\\,\\rm{km}\\, \\rm{s}^{-1} \\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with other\nmass features, such as the $\\sim35\\,M_\\odot$ peak.

Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities,\nbecause our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and\nhave likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks.\nNevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a\nkick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar\npopulations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local\nstellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\\gtrsim 100$ km\ns$^{-1}$.

Decades of previous works have focused on establishing the primary\nformation and ionization mechanisms in different filaments. These studies have\npointed to a lack of star formation in the majority of the filaments, the\nimportance of magnetic fields and turbulence in several regions, and the role\nof interactions between the intercluster medium (ICM) and the cool gas in the\nfilaments, as well as the role of interaction between the central radio source,\n3C84, and the filaments.

This paper introduces a novel framework for image pre-processing\nthat integrates key algorithms specifically modified for GPU architecture,\nenabling large-scale image pre-processing for different algorithms. To prepare\nfor the new algorithm design paradigm in the AI era, we have implemented two\noperational modes in the framework for different application scenarios: Eager\nmode and Pipeline mode. The Eager mode facilitates real-time feedback and\nflexible adjustments, which could be used for parameter tuning and algorithm\ndevelopment. The pipeline mode is primarily designed for large scale data\nprocessing, which could be used for training or deploying of artificial\nintelligence models.

In order to statistically infer merger redshifts, the\n``spectral standard siren\" method relies on features, such as peaks, dips or\nbreaks, in the compact object mass spectrum, which get redshifted in the\ndetector-frame relative to the source-frame. However, if the source-frame\nlocation of these features evolves over cosmic time, the spectral siren\nmeasurement may be biased. Some features, such as the edges of the\npair-instability supernova mass gap, may be more stable than others. We point\nout that binary black hole (BBH) spins, which are not redshifted in the\ndetector-frame, provide a natural way to identify robust mass scales for\nspectral siren cosmology. For example, there is recent evidence for a mass\nscale in the BBH population that separates slowly spinning from more rapidly\nspinning BBH mergers, consistent with the lower edge of the pair instability\ngap. Applying our method to data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third transient\ncatalog, we demonstrate how to isolate this mass scale and produce a robust\n``spinning spectral siren\" measurement of the Hubble constant: $H_0 =\n85^{+99}_{-67}\\,\\rm{km}\\, \\rm{s}^{-1} \\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, or $H_0\n=80^{+60}_{-46}\\,\\rm{km}\\, \\rm{s}^{-1} \\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with other\nmass features, such as the $\\sim35\\,M_\\odot$ peak.

To reconcile these tensions via late-time\nmodifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing\nin the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high\nredshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized\nwithin the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities.\nIn this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the\nframework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity\nand self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features\nlike phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts\nwithout introducing any instabilities.

We find a positive correlation between LOS velocity\ndispersion ($\\sigma_v$) and $N_\\text{HI}$ with a logarithmic index of\n${\\sim}0.5$. Based on existing turbulent mixing layer (TML) theories and\nsimulations, we propose a scenario of hot gas cooling and accreting onto the\ndisk through a TML, which could reproduce the observed power index of\n${\\sim}0.5$. We estimate the related cooling and accretion rates to be roughly\n$1/3$ to $2/3$ of the star-formation rate. A typical column density of diffuse\nHI (${\\sim}10^{19}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$) can be accreted within $300\\,\\text{Myr}$,\nthe interaction time scale previously estimated for the system. Such a gas\naccretion channel has been overlooked before, and may be important for gas-rich\ninteracting systems and for high redshift galaxy evolution.\n","authors":["Xuchen Lin","Jing Wang","Lister Staveley-Smith","Suoqing Ji","Dong Yang","Xinkai Chen","Fabian Walter","Hsiao-Wen Chen","Luis C.

Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft\nlevel is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned\ncryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit,\nwhile a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift\ndown to the 50 mK required by the detectors.

This enables an increase in\nthe multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument\nenergy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV\nresolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more\nthan a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a\n4' field of view (compared to 5' before).

Depending on whether this\ndecrease occurs before, at, or after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta,\nthree distinct classes of light curves emerge.

While simulating systems that experience rapid changes in\nthese conditions, it is essential to adapt the (time-) step size to capture the\nbehavior of the system during those rapid changes and use a less accurate time\nstep at other, less demanding, moments. We encounter three problems with\ntraditional methods. Firstly, making such changes requires expert knowledge of\nthe astrophysics as well as of the details of the numerical implementation.\nSecondly, some parameters that determine the time-step size are fixed\nthroughout the simulation, which means that they do not adapt to the rapidly\nchanging conditions of the problem. Lastly, we would like the choice of\ntime-step size to balance accuracy and computation effort. We address these\nchallenges with Reinforcement Learning by training it to select the time-step\nsize dynamically. We use the integration of a system of three equal-mass bodies\nthat move due to their mutual gravity as an example of its application. With\nour method, the selected integration parameter adapts to the specific\nrequirements of the problem, both in terms of computation time and accuracy\nwhile eliminating the expert knowledge needed to set up these simulations. Our\nmethod produces results competitive to existing methods and improve the results\nfound with the most commonly-used values of time-step parameter. This method\ncan be applied to other integrators without further retraining. We show that\nthis extrapolation works for variable time-step integrators but does not\nperform to the desired accuracy for fixed time-step integrators.\n","authors":["Veronica Saz Ulibarrena","Simon Portegies Zwart"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12809v1.pdf","comment":"27 pages, 14 figures.

We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time\nspan of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one\ncan obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median\ncadence prolonged to 12 days. We find that ZTF classification is superior to\nthe PS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements. Additionally,\nwe find that the light curves provide the most important features for QSO\nclassification in the ZTF dataset. We robustly classify objects fainter than\nthe $5\\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g < \\mathrm{n_{obs}} / 80 +\n20.375$. For this sample, we run inference with added WISE observations, and\nfind 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs. For 33% of QZO objects, with\navailable WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\\Delta z/(1 +\nz) = 0.14$.\n","authors":["S. J. Nakoneczny","M. J. Graham","D. Stern","G. Helou","S. G.

We find that how filaments\naffect the HI gas is generally less significant compared to the halo\nenvironment. There is a weak trend in the observations at z=0 that low-mass\nhaloes lying closer to the filaments tend to have reduced HI masses. However,\nthis trend reverses for massive haloes with log(Mvir/Msun) > 12.5. This\nbehaviour is accurately reproduced in the NUM model due to the dependence of HI\ngas on the halo formation time, but it does not appear in IllustrisTNG. The\ninfluence of filaments on the HI gas becomes slightly weaker at higher\nredshifts and is only significant for galaxies that reside in massive haloes in\nthe NUM model.

Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is\nchallenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical\nuncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to\nblack hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for\ngas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in\nlarge-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the \"Learning\nthe Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial\nconditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using\na Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we\nupdate the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based\ninflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple\nmodel for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive\nblack hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters.\nOnce the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly\nsimilar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the\ndetails in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole\nregime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion\nmechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive\nblack holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high\nredshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high\nredshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies\nand mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same\nblack hole formation model.\n","authors":["Rainer Weinberger","Aklant Bhowmick","Laura Blecha","Greg Bryan","Johannes Buchner","Lars Hernquist","Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo","Volker Springel"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13241v1.pdf","comment":"19 pages, 13 figures, submitted to A&A, comments welcome.

A\nsurprising finding is reported here that both a ring and a sphere (shell) can\nbe stable in the restricted three-body problem. First, if two primary masses\nare considered in orbit about their common centre of mass, a large, uniform,\ninfinitesimal ring enclosing the smaller of the masses can in principle be\nstable under certain conditions. Similarly, a Dyson sphere can, be stable, if\nthe sphere encloses the smaller of the two primary masses, again under certain\nconditions. These findings extend Maxwell's results on the dynamics of rings\nand have an interesting bearing on so-called Ringworlds and Dyson spheres from\nfiction.

Applying the model to nearby galaxies","summary":"  Many spiral galaxies host magnetic fields with energy densities comparable to\nthose of the turbulent and thermal motions of their interstellar gas. However,\nquantitative comparison between magnetic field properties inferred from\nobservation and those obtained from theoretical modeling has been lacking. In\nPaper I we developed a simple, axisymmetric galactic dynamo model that uses\nvarious observational data as input. Here we apply our model to calculate\nradial profiles of azimuthally and vertically averaged magnetic field strength\nand pitch angle, gas velocity dispersion and scale height, turbulent\ncorrelation time and length, and the sizes of supernova remnants for the\ngalaxies M31, M33, M51, and NGC 6946, using input data collected from the\nliterature. Scaling factors are introduced to account for a lack of precision\nin both theory and observation. Despite the simplicity of our model, its\noutputs agree fairly well with galaxy properties inferred from observation.\nAdditionally, we find that most of the parameter values are similar between\ngalaxies. We extend the model to predict the magnetic field pitch angles\narising from a combination of mean-field dynamo action and the winding up of\nthe random small-scale field owing to the large-scale radial shear. We find\ntheir magnitudes to be much smaller than those of the pitch angles measured in\npolarized radio and far infrared emission. This suggests that effects not\nincluded in our model, such as effects associated with spiral arms, are needed\nto explain the pitch angle values.\n","authors":["Rion Glenn Nazareth","Gayathri Santhosh","Luke Chamandy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13029v1.pdf","comment":"27 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, submitted to the Astrophysical\n  Journal (ApJ)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08658v2","updated":"2025-02-18T16:38:44Z","published":"2024-11-13T14:47:37Z","title":"Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation\n  gravitational-wave observatories","summary":"  By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe,\nnext-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic\nExplorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of\ncosmic history.

For the small $^{12}$C($\\alpha,\n\\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further\nenhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is\nstrengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the\ncontraction of outer layers and decrease the {\\sl compactness parameter} at\n$M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores\nof Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell\nin the presupernova models.

Emission-line\n  Redshift Measurement for Slitless Spectra","summary":"  The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a forthcoming space-based optical\ntelescope designed to co-orbit with the Chinese Space Station. With a planned\nslitless spectroscopic survey spanning a broad wavelength range of $255-1000$nm\nand an average spectral resolution exceeding 200, the CSST holds significant\npotential for cosmic large-scale structure analysis. In this study, we focus on\nredshift determinations from slitless spectra through emission line analysis\nwithin the CSST framework. Our tailored redshift measurement process involves\nidentifying emission lines in one-dimensional slitless spectra, aligning\nobserved wavelengths with their rest-frame counterparts from prominent galaxy\nemissions, and calculating wavelength shifts to determine redshifts accurately.\nTo validate our redshift measurement algorithm, we leverage simulated spectra\ngenerated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. The outcomes\ndemonstrate a remarkable redshift completeness exceeding 95 per cent for\nemission line galaxies (ELGs), alongside a purity surpassing 85 per cent. The\nredshift uncertainty remains impressively below than $\\sim 0.001$. Notably,\nwhen concentrating on galaxies with more than three matched emission lines, the\ncompleteness of ELGs and the purity of measurable galaxies can reach 98 per\ncent and 97 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the influence of\nparameters like magnitude, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift on\nredshift completeness and purity. The discussion also delves into redshift\ndegeneracies stemming from emission-line matching confusion. Our developed\nredshift measurement process will be applied to extensive simulated datasets\nand forthcoming CSST slitless spectroscopic observations for further\ncosmological and extragalactic analyses.\n","authors":["Jipeng Sui","Hu Zou","Xiaohu Yang","Xianzhong Zheng","Run Wen","Yizhou Gu","Weiyu Ding","Lu Feng","Hong Guo","Wei-Jian Guo","Yunkun Han","Yipeng Jing","Cheng Li","Wenxiong Li","Shufei Liu","Zhixia Shen","Gaurav Singh","Jiali Wang","Peng Wei","Yunao Xiao","Suijian Xue","Hu Zhan","Pengjie Zhang","Gongbo Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11536v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08539v2","updated":"2025-02-18T02:49:15Z","published":"2024-09-13T05:03:53Z","title":"NeutralUniverseMachine: How Filaments and Dark Matter Halo Influence the\n  Galaxy Cold Gas Content","summary":"  Aims. We aim to investigate the influence of the distance to filaments and\ndark-matter haloes on galaxy cold-gas content in the empirical model\nNeutralUniverseMachine (NUM) and the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG.\nMethods. We used DisPerSE to identify cosmic web structures and calculate the\ndistance of galaxies to filaments for both observations and models. We show the\nresults of the HI and H2 mass functions, HI- and H2-halo-mass relations, HI-\nand H2-stellar-mass relations for galaxies in the NUM model and IllustrisTNG\nwith different distances to filaments and compare them with observational\nmeasurements. We also show the evolution of HI and H2 mass densities at\ndifferent distances to filament bins. Results. We find that how filaments\naffect the HI gas is generally less significant compared to the halo\nenvironment. There is a weak trend in the observations at z=0 that low-mass\nhaloes lying closer to the filaments tend to have reduced HI masses. However,\nthis trend reverses for massive haloes with log(Mvir/Msun) > 12.5. This\nbehaviour is accurately reproduced in the NUM model due to the dependence of HI\ngas on the halo formation time, but it does not appear in IllustrisTNG. The\ninfluence of filaments on the HI gas becomes slightly weaker at higher\nredshifts and is only significant for galaxies that reside in massive haloes in\nthe NUM model. Filaments have almost no impact on the H2-stellar-mass relation\nin both models, confirming that H2 is primarily determined by the galaxy\nstellar mass and star formation rate.\n","authors":["Wenlin Ma","Hong Guo","Michael G.

In collisionless systems within the stable parameter\nrange, the eigenvalue spectrum consists of a continuous set of real frequencies\nassociated with van Kampen modes, which are singular eigenfunctions of the\nstellar DF. An initial perturbation in the stellar density and gravitational\npotential decays exponentially through a superposition of these modes, a\nphenomenon known as Landau damping. However, the perturbation in the stellar DF\ndoes not decay self-similarly; it becomes increasingly oscillatory in velocity\nspace over time, indicating the absence of eigenfunctions corresponding to the\nLandau damping eigenfrequencies. Consequently, we refer to perturbations\nundergoing Landau damping as quasi-modes rather than true eigenmodes. Even rare\ncollisions suppress the formation of steep DF gradients in velocity space. Ng &\nBhattacharjee (2021) demonstrated that introducing collisions eliminates van\nKampen modes and transforms Landau quasi-modes into true eigenmodes forming a\ncomplete set.

Stars with masses\n$m\\gtrsim3M_\\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive\nstellar-mass black holes, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\\approx\n10$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an\nover-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events.

The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter\nrelaxation times of heavier black holes, allowing them to segregate into the\nsphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance.\nThe additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier\nblack holes to circularize and sink inward more efficiently.

Recent multi-messenger observations, including\ngravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from\nNASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have\nsignificantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study\ninvestigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on\nNICER's latest observation of PSR J0437-4715. We employ Bayesian inference\ntechniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a\npiecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple\nNICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters,\nincluding critical density and transition depth. We find that including data\nfrom PSR J0437-4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the\nEOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis\nonly indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and\ncurrent observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.\nIn particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition\nmass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with\nthe approximate mass range of PSR J0437-4715.

For planets orbiting their\nstars at distances of approximately 10 stellar radii or less, these effects are\nsignificantly intensified. Such interactions can be investigated through a\ncombination of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies\nspanning wavelengths from X-rays to radio frequencies. When a hot planet\nresides within the star's sub-Alfv\\'enic radius, magnetic star-planet\ninteractions (SPI) become possible, often observable as stellar activity\nenhancements influenced by the planet's orbital motion rather than stellar\nrotation alone. Such interactions offer a unique perspective on the atmospheric\nerosion and magnetospheric characteristics of close-in exoplanets.The behavior\nand impacts of these magnetic interactions are highly sensitive to the magnetic\nfields of both the planet and its host star.

The\ninferred metallicity spreads for many GCs are comparable or even larger than\nthose observed in dwarf galaxies. This result is clearly unexpected and at odds\nwith the birth time of stars in dwarf galaxies, spanning several billion years,\nas opposed to very short formation times of the stellar component in GCs (a few\nmillion years). The contradiction is corroborated by the comparison of the\nwidths of red giant branches in both classes of objects.

The matched-filter method is applied to recover the injected\nsatellites. We derive the observational selection function of the survey in\nterms of the luminosity, half-light radius, and heliocentric distance of the\nsatellites. Compared to a catalogue-level simulation as used in previous\nstudies, the image-level simulation provides a more realistic assessment of\nsurvey sensitivity, accounting for observational limitations that are neglected\nin catalogue-level simulations. The image-level simulation shows a detection\nloss for compact sources with a distance $d \\gtrsim 100~\\rm kpc$. We argue that\nthis is because compact sources are more likely to be identified as single\nsources rather than being resolved during the source extraction process.\n","authors":["Shiyang Zhang","Hendrik Hildebrandt","Ziang Yan","Simon E.

This\ninequality can be tested from observational data. In fact, no violation for it\nhas been found from the CMB data provided by the COBE satellite in different\nsky directions. This is a result which, being negative, is not conclusive in\nrelation to the possible violation of the CHSH inequality in a cosmological\ncontext. So, the preceding analysis needs to be extended by using more precise\ncurrent CMB data, like those provided by WMAP and Planck satellites. This is a\ntask of considerable importance but, technically, much more involved in data\ntreatments. In this work, assuming again local realism behind measurements and\nobservational data, this extension is accomplished. The result is that a sound\nviolation of the CHSH inequality is found, which would mean the failure of the\nassumed local realism in accordance with the quantum origin of the primordial\ntemperature fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation and the\northodox interpretation of the Quantum Mechanics.\n","authors":["Roberto Dale","Jesús M.

It has become a critical constraint for galaxy formation models.\nOver the past decade, growing evidence has convincingly shown that the stellar\nmass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for star-forming and quiescent central\ngalaxies differ significantly: at a given stellar mass, the average host halo\nmass of quiescent centrals is more massive than that of the star-forming\ncentrals.

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that the semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES successfully\nreproduces these observational results, whereas three state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations (TNG, Illustris, and EAGLE) do not.\nConsequently, in L-GALAXIES, star-forming central galaxies are more efficient\nat converting baryons into stars than quiescent central galaxies at a given\nhalo mass, while the other models predict similar efficiencies for both\npopulations. Further analysis reveals that these fundamental discrepancies stem\nfrom distinct evolutionary paths on the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We show\nthat the observed SHMRs for star-forming and quiescent galaxies support galaxy\nformation models in which quenching only weakly correlates with halo assembly\nhistories, and in which the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies can increase\nsignificantly since cosmic noon. In contrast, models in which quenching\nstrongly prefers to happen in early-formed halos are not very favored.\nAdditionally, we find that galaxy downsizing is present in L-GALAXIES and TNG,\nbut absent in Illustris and EAGLE.\n","authors":["Kai Wang","Yingjie Peng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07743v2.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 4 figures, ApJ accepted"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13644v1","updated":"2025-02-19T11:37:25Z","published":"2025-02-19T11:37:25Z","title":"Dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls with bias directions","summary":"  The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of\ndomain walls in the early Universe.

The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet\ninhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is\nnotable because the daisies lead to an emergent \"regulation\" of the planet's\ntemperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the\nco-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in\nthe teaching of Earth system science.\n  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight)\ncan cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle\nsurvive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically,\nthis occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous)\nsystem crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen\n(autonomous) system.

However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the\nturbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive\nthe observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially\nextended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We\npropose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of\nprotoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box\nsimulations.

This idea has been recently rekindled\nby the observation (signal-to-noise ratio of about 15$\\sigma$) of a phosphine\n(PH$_3$) absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper,\nhotter layers of the atmosphere. There is a chance that this observation could\nbe a sign of life, because the PH$_3$ gas observed on Earth originates mostly\nin decaying organic material. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is no\nother natural process on Venus that could otherwise produce the observed PH$_3$\nabsorption line. On the other hand, cosmic rays and the particle cascades they\nproduce in the Earth's atmosphere are hazardous to living organisms, because\nthe ionizing radiation produced in air showers can blow apart chemical\nmolecules and disrupt biochemical processes, causing cells to die or undergo\ndangerous mutations. Compared to Earth, the hypothesized biosphere of Venus\ncould be exposed to substantially more ionizing radiation. This is because\nVenus has no protective intrinsic magnetic field, orbits closer to the Sun, and\nthe entire eventual habitable region lies in the clouds high in the atmosphere.\nThereby, if the clouds were sterilized there would be no reservoir of deeper\nlife that can recolonize afterwards. In this communication we study the effects\nof particle cascades in the venusian atmosphere using the AIRES simulation\npackage properly configured.

Despite the importance of this feature, its scientific implications\nhave not yet been fully recognized or thoroughly explored in the field. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that the semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES successfully\nreproduces these observational results, whereas three state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations (TNG, Illustris, and EAGLE) do not.\nConsequently, in L-GALAXIES, star-forming central galaxies are more efficient\nat converting baryons into stars than quiescent central galaxies at a given\nhalo mass, while the other models predict similar efficiencies for both\npopulations. Further analysis reveals that these fundamental discrepancies stem\nfrom distinct evolutionary paths on the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We show\nthat the observed SHMRs for star-forming and quiescent galaxies support galaxy\nformation models in which quenching only weakly correlates with halo assembly\nhistories, and in which the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies can increase\nsignificantly since cosmic noon. In contrast, models in which quenching\nstrongly prefers to happen in early-formed halos are not very favored.\nAdditionally, we find that galaxy downsizing is present in L-GALAXIES and TNG,\nbut absent in Illustris and EAGLE.\n","authors":["Kai Wang","Yingjie Peng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07743v2.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 4 figures, ApJ accepted"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13696v1","updated":"2025-02-19T13:10:02Z","published":"2025-02-19T13:10:02Z","title":"SEW: A full-spectrum linear fitting with stellar population synthesis\n  method Based on \"Equivalent Widths spectrum\"","summary":"  We present a full-spectrum linear fitting method, SEW, for stellar population\nsynthesis based on equivalent widths (EWs) to extract galaxy properties from\nobserved spectra.

This mass scale marks a\nmaximum in star formation efficiency, where galaxies are minimally affected by\nprocesses like SN and AGN feedback. We use \\textsc{camels} cosmological\nsimulations, based on the IllustrisTNG subgrid, to study the origin of this\nmass scale and whether it persists when varying feedback from SN and AGN. We\nfocus on the correlation between the total-to-stellar mass within the half-mass\nradius and stellar mass, which follows an inverted bell-shaped trend, with a\nminimum at the golden mass. SN feedback processes impact the emergence of the\ngolden mass, which shifts to lower mass for high values of wind velocity and\nenergy. We find that most AGN feedback parameters influence the emergence of\nthe golden mass, altering the correlation slope at high mass: the black hole\nradiative efficiency is the most impactful, followed by the black hole feedback\nfactor and quasar threshold. ETGs preserve the inverted bell-shaped trend,\nwhile LTGs have monotonically decreasing DM fractions with mass, with mild\nindication of an inversion only at low redshift, confirming results from\nobservations. When connecting with global quantities, we see that star\nformation efficiency show a bell-shaped trend peaking at the golden mass, with\nbehaviours that mirror the central quantities. In ETGs a peak at lower mass is\nseen, while LTGs mirror the behaviour in the central quantity, with mild\nindication of a maximum in the stellar fraction only at low redshift.

In this study, we aim to reproduce the broadband spectrum, the\nH$\\beta$ line delay, and the continuum time delays available for the source NGC\n5548. We employ the standard accretion disk model with the option of an inner\nhot flow, alongside the lamp-post model to account for disk irradiation and a\nBLR structure model based on radiation pressure acting on dust. The model is\nparameterized by the black hole mass (fixed), accretion rate, viewing angle,\nlamp-post height, cloud density, and cloud covering factor. The resulting\ncontinuum delays are calculated as a combination of disk reprocessing and the\nreprocessing of a fraction of radiation by the BLR.

In recent efforts to increase the\nnumber of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected\na sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the\nHerschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that\nstands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use\nmolecular lines that trace dense gas (n>=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the\nexceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and\nto understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4\ntransitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We\nuse the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the\ncore's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five\nlines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very\nhigh densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We\ninfer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced\nevolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect\nseveral other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also\ndetect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of\nhigh-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and\nthe fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing\nfrequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall\nmotions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or\nas the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO).\n*SHORTENED*\n","authors":["E.

I.\n  Small-amplitude Alfvénic waves","summary":"  The large abundance of electrically neutral particles has a remarkable impact\non the dynamics of many astrophysical plasmas. Here, we use a two-fluid model\nthat includes charge-neutral elastic collisions and Hall's current to study the\npropagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in weakly ionized plasmas. we\nderive the dispersion relation for small-amplitude incompressible transverse\nwaves propagating along the background magnetic field. Then, we focus on the\npolarization relations fulfilled by the eigenmodes and their corresponding\nratios of magnetic to kinetic energies, and we study their dependence on the\nrelations between the oscillation, collision and cyclotron frequencies. For low\nwave frequencies, the two components of the plasma are strongly coupled, the\ndamping due to the charge-neutral interaction is weak and the effect of Hall's\nterm is negligible. However, as the wave frequency increases, phase shifts\nbetween the velocity of charges, the velocity of neutrals, and the magnetic\nfield appear, leading to enhanced damping. The effect of collisions on the\npropagation of waves strongly depends on their polarization state, with the\nleft-handed circularly polarized ion-cyclotron modes being more efficiently\ndamped than the linearly polarized Alfv\\'en waves and the right-handed\ncircularly polarized whistler modes. Moreover, the equipartition relation\nbetween the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of Alfv\\'en waves does not\nhold in general when the collisional interaction and Hall's current are taken\ninto account, with the magnetic energy usually dominating over the kinetic\nenergy. This theoretical result extends previous findings from observational\nand numerical works about turbulence in astrophysical scenarios.\n","authors":["David Martínez-Gómez"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13659v1.pdf","comment":"25 pages, 16 figures.

While the luminosity increase as\nconsequence of mass transfer is more limited, it may help to increase the\nnumber of overluminous RSGs.

This makes it a\nparticularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of\nplanetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of\nthe protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge.\nOur goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting\nbeyond the outermost known one, $\\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to\nassess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy\nbetween the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\\sim$28 au with only\ntwo planets, and the observed one at $\\sim$50 au. We performed an exhaustive\ndynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by\nintroducing one or two additional planets beyond $\\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with\nthe disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass,\nsemi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further\ncarried out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3.\nOur simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of\n0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and\n36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge\nat 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the\npresence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also\naccount for these observations. While we find that one or even two additional\nplanets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these\nhypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational\nlimits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved\nsensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.\n","authors":["A. Lacquement","H. Beust","V. Faramaz-Gorka","G.

With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry\nin detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered\nin the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular\nabundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in\nthese atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown\ndwarfs and exoplanets.

We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and\nfree molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as\nunresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O,\nCH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2\n(at 13.4$\\sigma$ and 9.5$\\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere.\nThe detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing\n($K_{zz}\\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature\nderivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is\nthe C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models\nfor isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical\nmixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint\ntowards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving\naurorae, or lightning driving ionization.

An emerging paradigm suggests that radially\nextended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We\npropose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of\nprotoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box\nsimulations.

The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy\ngeneral expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind\nparameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic\nobservations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected\nALMA survey data of Class II disks.
